Brain Drain recounts in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] his origin to [[Captain America]], explaining how a falling meteorite all but killed him. The \"meteorite\" was in fact a spaceship, with the four alien inhabitants saving Schmidt's brain and eyes and placing them in a robot body. With his brain waves heightened during the process, Schmidt dubs himself \"Brain Drain\" and taking mental control of the aliens - which he calls \"Star Gods\" - renames them after old German gods: [[Donar]], Log, [[Froh]], and [[Brunnhilde]]. When Brunnhilde is released, she taunts Brain Drain into committing suicide in a vat of chemicals, which destroy the characters. The Invaders escape as the aliens then destroy themselves and the installation.<ref>''The Invaders'' # 1-2 (Aug.&Oct. 1975)</ref>\n\nThe character is mentioned by fellow [[Nazism|Nazi]] villain [[Red Skull]] in the title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'',<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #30 (June 1976)</ref> and reappears in a two-part story in the title ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'', and together with Nazi allies [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]], [[U-Man]] and ''Skyshark'' plans to sabotage [[New York City]] with a new super weapon. The plan, however, is foiled by time-travelling [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the [[Liberty Legion]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #1 (Jan. 1976) & ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #20 (Oct. 1976)</ref>\n\nThe title ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' reveals that Brain Drain's brain casing is apparently lost in the snow below a mountain for decades, and is rescued after taking mental control of a nearby hiker. The character allies himself with the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master]], a perennial foe of the superhero team Alpha Flight. Joining the Master's team [[Omega Flight]] in a new robot body, Brain Drain and other villains battle the heroes on several occasions, before finally being defeated.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #108 (May 1992); #110 - 112 (July-Sep. 1992) & #129 - 130 (Feb.-March 1994)</ref>\n\nBrain Drain is mentioned in the [[One-shot (comics)|one shot]] ''Miss America Comics 70th Anniversary Special'', as heroine [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]] believes the character to be the mastermind behind a Nazi plan.<ref>''Miss America Comics 70th Anniversary Special'' (Aug. 2009)</ref>\n\nBrain Drain returns as an antagonist in ''[[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl]]'' and is quickly defeated due to his extremely outdated technology (such as vacuum tubes) and crucial design flaws (specifically exposed wires).
