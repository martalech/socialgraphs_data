Spider-Man intervened and saved the ambassador, making him an enemy of the Femme Fatales.

Though the villains got away.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #340, 342-343.</ref>\n\nThe Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join [[Superia]] and her organization of female criminals, the [[Femizons]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, the Femme Fatales are joined by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and [[Sapphire Styx]], with Whiplash changing her name to Snake Whip.
