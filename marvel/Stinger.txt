Two of its members, Tower and Frenzy, had appeared before the rest of the team.\n\nThe team subsequently appears in ''X-Factor'' #33 (October 1988), and ''New Mutants Annual'' #7 (1991).\n\nThe Alliance of Evil received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #1.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\nThe Alliance of Evil was once [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s personal strike force, and carried out his bidding.  Their first mission was to find and capture Michael Nowlan, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to heighten other mutants' powers.  When Nowlan tried to leave, they kidnapped his girlfriend, Suzy, to use as bait.  [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] found Nowlan and vowed to protect him. When the Alliance traced him down, they threatened Suzy to make him power them up. The Alliance fought and defeated X-Factor, bringing Nowlan back to their master. X-Factor eventually found their hideout, and on Apocalypse's orders Nowlan powered up the Alliance again.  When Suzy tried to escape, Stinger's bolts accidentally kill her.  Nowlan killed himself, and Apocalypse abandoned the Alliance of Evil and escaped.<ref>''X-Factor'' #5-6 (June\u2013July 1986)</ref>\n\nMuch later, the Alliance of Evil caused a commotion over the [[Registration acts (comics)#Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]].  X-Factor saw them on the news and immediately attacked the Alliance. They were defeated by X-Factor and taken into custody by [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #33 (October 1988)</ref>\n\nThe group, minus Timeshadow, later encountered the [[New Mutants]], along with Harness and [[Piecemeal (Gilbert Benson)|Piecemeal]].  They were defeated, and when questioned later, Frenzy admitted to being hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to bodyguard Harness and Piecemeal.  She was then dropped out of a helicopter.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #7 (1991)</ref>\n\nThe group eventually disbanded.  Frenzy went on to join the ranks of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto's]] [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] and later the X-Men themselves, Tower was killed by the [[X-Cutioner]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #17 (1993)</ref> Stinger was seen befriending Iceman on the X-Men's home island of Utopia,<ref>''Nation X'' #1 (2009)</ref>\nand Timeshadow has not been seen since.\n\n==Members==\n\n===Employers===\n* '''[[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)]]'''\n*'''[[Piecemeal (Gilbert Benson)]]''' - son of Harness\n\n===Agents===\n* '''[[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy (Joanna Cargill)]]''' - field leader of the Alliance, a super-strong mutant with steel-hard skin and resistance to temperature extremes.

She had returned to the Acolytes after Exdous reformed the group, having retained her mutant powers, but now resides on Utopia.<ref>Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus</ref>\n* '''[[Tower (comics)|Tower (Edward Pasternak)]]''' - a mutant with the ability to increase his size and strength.
