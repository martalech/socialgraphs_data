She has been a member of [[supervillain]] groups, including the [[Alliance of Evil]] and the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], as well as the [[superhero]] team, the [[X-Men]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}\nFrenzy first appeared in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #4 (May 1986) as a member of the [[Alliance of Evil]], and was created by [[Bob Layton]] and [[Keith Pollard]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=139}}</ref>\n\nThough Joanna Cargill's first and last name have been spelled with variations such as Johanna or Cargil, her name was first mentioned in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #298 as Joanna Cargill. Frenzy should not be confused with another Joanna Cargill, a columnist introduced in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #27.\n\nDuring a March 2, 2011 Marvel Comics Liveblog, it was revealed that Frenzy is joining ''X-Men: Legacy'' in 2011 as a member of Rogue's team of X-Men, alongside Professor X, Magneto, Legion, and Gambit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15282/tune_in_to_year_of_the_x-men_liveblogs|title = Marvel News, Blog, Articles & Press Releases &#124; Marvel}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life===\nThe woman who would one day become the super-powered mutant, Frenzy, began her life as a battered child in an abusive household. Her father, an officer in the Armed Forces, despised her from birth not only because of her gender - he instead doted on his son in whom, according to Cargill, he saw a continuation of the family legacy as soldiers - but also because she was born prematurely, and was a sickly, frail child, greatly increasing the financial burdens on the family. Her mother, meanwhile, was thoroughly cowed by her husband's abuse, and did nothing to stop the beatings he would constantly inflict on his daughter for even seemingly minor infractions. One day, not long after his son was killed in action, he took his rage out on his daughter for the death of his son, seemingly wanting to beat her to death. Either her rage or her fear awakened her mutant powers as he beat her savagely, and she unintentionally punched straight through his body with a single blow, killing him instantly. Shocked at what she had done, albeit accidentally, she ran away from home.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy,'' #268 (June 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Alliance of Evil===\nOriginally a freelance mercenary, Frenzy joins with three other mutants \u2014 [[Tower (comics)|Tower]], [[Stinger (comics)|Stinger]], and [[Timeshadow]] \u2014 under the employ of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], calling themselves the [[Alliance of Evil]].

Frenzy is unable to convince Rusty to join the Alliance, and fled after suffering defeat from X-Factor. The Alliance later reveals they had a power-enhancing accomplice named Michael Nowlan. After he tries to escape from the Alliance, the group threatens to kill Nowlan's girlfriend, Suzy. X-Factor interferes in the Alliance's plans, eventually defeating them and putting them into custody.<ref>''X-Factor'' #4-5 (1986).

As was common among the Acolytes, she relinquished her codename, preferring to be called by her last name, Cargill. Their first mission was to capture a child with latent mutant powers from Our Mother of the Sacred Heart, a school. During the mission, Cargill killed [[Sharon Friedlander]], and with her teammates [[Unuscione]] and the [[Kleinstocks]], battled the gold [[X-Men]] team. Having history with [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] (they met and clashed during a mission when they were mercenaries-for-hire), she immediately went after him and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. However, Gambit was able to defeat her by hitting her with a kinetically charged tire.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #298 (1993).

They crash landed in [[Australia]] but were given to the authorities.<ref>''X-Men'' #42-44 (1995).

After confronting [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] over his choices with his father, Cargill was defeated by [[Scarlet Witch]]. Later, Cargill appeared on television, ordering that every country pledge loyalty to Magneto in order to be given some autonomy. She was eventually captured by the government in an attempt to find out more of Magneto's plans, but she refused to speak. [[Jean Grey]] freed Cargill and mind-controlled her. Cargill's knowledge of Genosha helped the X-Men find Magneto's base. The inexperienced X-Men attacked but were quickly defeated.
