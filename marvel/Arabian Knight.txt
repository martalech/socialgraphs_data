He was a good hand-to-hand combatant and was an exceptional swordsman, particularly in the use of the scimitar. He possesses three magical weapons: a [[magic carpet]], a [[gold]]en [[scimitar]] emitting beams of magical force, and a mind-controlled belt/sash. Indeed, ''all'' three items respond, exclusively, to his mental commands. He discovered his weapons, which had belonged to a 13th-century ancestor, in an underground tomb in the [[Egypt]]ian desert. The magic carpet and sash are formed from a material that is virtually indestructible, resisting fire, and even bullets. The carpet permitted him to travel, flying, at high speeds and altitudes, while the belt/sash magically elongates to approximately {{convert|40|ft|m}} in length (almost 10 times its typical length), and can serve as a weapon (whip), or as a climbing rope, or to capture and restrain his foes. The golden scimitar, in addition to firing destructive blasts, will \"backfire\" against any other person who may attempt to wield it.\n\nThe next Arabian Knight revealed that the magic carpet used by the first Arabian Knight was unraveled and made into an indestructible uniform that responds to his thoughts. He still uses the magic scimitar and wears the red magic sash around his waist. The uniform serves as body armor that protects him from harm and allows him to fly.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Comic Book Resources]] placed the original Arabian Knight as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|website=CBR|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Other characters named Arabian Knight==\nAn unrelated character named Arabian Knight appeared in ''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #15 (June 2006). He was depicted as a [[Muslim]] warrior who won the right to use the magical [[scimitar]], [[magic carpet|carpet]], and armor due to trial by combat. This Arabian Knight showed up as a part of an international attempt to invade [[Wakanda]], and was defeated by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #15 (June 2006).
