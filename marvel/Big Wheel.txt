Fearing that he might be caught, he hires a youthful criminal named [[Rocket Racer]] to steal the evidence that incriminates him. However, Rocket Racer opts to use the evidence to blackmail Weele instead. Despairing, Weele tries to commit suicide, but Rocket Racer prevents him from doing so. However, Racer is not particularly kind to Weele, disparagingly referring to him as \"Big Weele\". Humiliated by Rocket Racer's taunts, Weele visits the mechanical genius and underworld supplier [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]], who the Rocket Racer boasted had upgraded his equipment. At Weele's urging, the Tinkerer creates a large metal wheel that can climb up buildings, complete with guns and waldo-arms.<ref name=autogenerated1>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #183. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Big-wheel-rocket-racer.jpg|frame|right|Big Wheel vs. [[Rocket Racer]].]]\nWith this new vehicle, Weele becomes the supervillain known as \"Big Wheel\". Newly empowered, Big Wheel hunts down and chases Rocket Racer across the city. In the process, he ends up fighting the title character, [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man is also seeking Rocket Racer, whom he had battled in a previous issue. Unfortunately, Weele lacks practice in using his new device and, in the heat of battle, the Big Wheel topples off a high rooftop and plunges into the Hudson River. Spider-Man tries to save him, but comes up empty-handed. He presumes Jackson Weele died when the Big Wheel vehicle sank to the bottom of the river.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nBig Wheel did not appear in another comic book for more than twenty years. However, the story was picked up again by writer Cristos Gage. Weele survives his seemingly deadly encounter, turning up again with his Big Wheel vehicle while Spider-Man is in combat with [[Stilt-Man]]. This time, Big Wheel attempts to help Spider-Man. However, due to his interference, Stilt-Man escapes. Confronted by Spider-Man, Weele reveals that, in the interim since their last meeting, he went to jail for embezzlement and joined Vil-Anon, an analog of Alcoholics Anonymous for super-villains. In fact, his attempt to help the hero was part of his twelve-step program. Out of pity, Spider-Man lets Big Wheel accompany him for the rest of the day. While foiling a bank robbery, the pair confronts the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]. Although they defeat him, Jackson Weele finally realizes that he is not cut out for super-heroics. He now makes his living using his Big Wheel rig in demolition derbies and speaking at events for Vil-Anon.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Big Wheel is discussed in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #21 (Jan. 2005) during a super-hero poker game. Spider-Man tells [[Reed Richards]] that the Big Wheel is one of the craziest things he has ever seen (along with a gang of mimes). The [[Human Torch]] says he has met the man at the 'Rusty Nail' and he is working as a security guard. The Torch also claims the Wheel's first name is Axel, although he may be joking.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Big Wheel is shown being chased by the Harbor Patrol, implying that he returned to super-heroics despite the doubts he harbored in ''Spider-Man Unlimited''.<ref>''Civil War: Frontline'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, he is brought in by Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] concerning black market connections that Iron Man believes may have aided [[Ezekiel Stane]].<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #7.

[[The Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) is later able to reverse the changes, restoring the Big Wheel to its intended appearance and power.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBig Wheel is later forced into committing crimes (such as stealing a prized pair of [[alpaca]]s) for Lady Caterpillar who had abducted his girlfriend Rebecca Townley.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = Travis Lanham|editor = Nick Lowe|title = Spider-Woman|volume = 5|issue = #6|date = 8 April 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\n===Second Big Wheel===\nAn unnamed operator of the Big Wheel was on a crime spree until he was defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day 2018 Amazing Spider-Man''.
