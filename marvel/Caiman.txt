The event started with a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue and took place in a number of various series all carrying the \"Decimation\" logo on the cover. The 2005 miniseries ''[[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'', ''[[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]]'', ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The 198]]'' were all launched specifically for the \"Decimation\" storyline. The various stories were collected in five trade paper backs.\n\nThe storyline focuses on the ramifications of the [[Scarlet Witch]] stripping nearly all of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] population of their powers, thereby reducing a society of millions to one of scant hundreds. This event, which occurred on November 2 according to [[X-Men: Legacy|''X-Men ''(vol. 2)]] #191, is known as \"'''M-Day'''\" in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\nReception among fans and critics was mixed, with a common complaint being the inconsistent manner in which mutants retained their powers while at times depicting \"depowered\" mutants as still having their physical mutations.\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main article|House of M}}\n\"Decimation\" began with the self-titled [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Decimation: House of M: The Day After'', and heralded the relaunch of the Excalibur team in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]'', focusing on [[Pete Wisdom]] looking for [[Captain Britain]] to head up a new British super team, as well as the relaunch of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' from the ''[[Jamie Madrox#MadroX|MadroX]]'' miniseries. It also includes several mini-series\u2014''[[Son of M]]'' starring a depowered [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], ''[[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'' focusing on other depowered characters, ''[[Sentinel Squad O*N*E]]'' showing the latest iteration of the mutant-hunting [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] to be robots piloted by humans, ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'', and ''[[X-Men: The 198]]''\u2014and continues throughout the Marvel Universe, particularly in the ''X-Men''-related titles. One consequence is an upswing of anti-mutant sentiment, especially among certain religious groups, who consider M-Day to be God's judgment against mutant-kind.\n\nIt has been confirmed through various sources that there are considerably more than 198 mutants remaining\u2014the number has been referred to as \"symbolic\" rather than actual, and in ''The 198 Files'' is said to be the earliest confirmed number. Numbers for pre-Decimation mutants vary from \"over a million\" (''House of M'' #8) to 14 million (''[[X-Men: Legacy|New X-Men]]'' #115, where it is said that the 16 million mutants who died on [[Genosha]] was around \"over half\" of the estimated global mutant population of 30 million mutants), giving a population, if the commonly used 90% depowered figure is true, of between one hundred thousand and one and a half million. Based on the mathematical comparisons of the oft-repeated 198 and several million, Marvel re-evaluated the 90% figure into \"over 99%\", as shown in ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' when [[Iron Man]] comments on the Post-CW world.<ref name=\"civilwarbattledamage\" >{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Ronald Byrd]] & [[Anthony Flamini]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\n\nBoth [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] note shortly after the event that it is impossible for the energy that certain mutants controlled to simply have vanished, and that it must have been \"sent\" somewhere. As would later be revealed in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', most of this energy became a [[Sentience|sentient]] entity called [[The Collective (comics)|the Collective]], who has since come into violent conflict with the Avengers.  In addition, a portion of the energy revived the body of [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Gabriel Summers]], brother of both Alex (Havok) and Scott Summers (Cyclops), who had been trapped in space for many years following the defeat of [[Krakoa]], as depicted in the ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' limited series.\n\n==Mutants affected==\nAccording to Marvel Editor-In-Chief [[Joe Quesada]], the \"Decimation\" event was designed to reduce the number of mutant characters in the [[Marvel Universe]], which he felt had gotten out of hand after forty years of publishing.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays21.html Newsarama.com: Joe Fridays 21, A Weekly Q&A with Joe Quesada<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415151629/http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays21.html |date=April 15, 2007 }}</ref> Most criticisms by fans have been aimed at inconsistencies regarding the roster of mutants who retained their powers after the event. For example, in the ''Generation M'' mini-series, several characters were considered depowered, even though they retained their physical mutations. The ''Civil War Files'' one-shot revealed that the US government's assessment of the number of mutants on Earth may not be accurate, which allowed Marvel to change the number of depowered mutants. Additionally, characters such as [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Namor]] and the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], who are described as mutants but not particularly tied to the ''X-Men'' series of books, have not been affected by the event.\n\n''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine published a speculative list of supposedly decimated characters, which Marvel Comics dismissed as including a number of mutants who still have their powers.{{Citation needed|reason=Original link does not exist|date=May 2020}} While it has been stated that there are at least 198 remaining mutants, according to [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] in  ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', there are actually \"around 300\"; the 198 number is merely the number of mutants the US government has cataloged, with a 199th mutant ([[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Mutant Zero]]) being off the record.<ref name=\"avengersinitiative5\" >{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Rafael (artist)|Rafael]] | Story = House Arrest | Title = Avengers Initiative | Issue = 5 | Date = November 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Over 198 mutants have already been identified post M-Day, more than 30 of whom have since died.{{update after|2021|3|27}}\n\n===Necrosha===\n{{Main article|Necrosha}}\n\n[[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and her servant Eli Bard have used the Transmode Virus to reanimate the mutant [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] so that he may track down and reanimate deceased mutants (to both form an army and an energy source for Selene). The reanimated army appeared in the \"Necrosha\" story arc, consisting of thousands of inhabitants of [[Genosha]], as well a number of notable deceased mutants associated with the X-Men. See the main Necrosha article to view the full list of those resurrected during the story arc.\n\n'''Necrosha notes''':\n* The majority of these mutants were used as a sacrifice for Selene to reach her godhood, and have since gone back to being deceased. Those who were not sacrificed likely perished with Selene and the energy she used to keep them alive, as was implied by Destiny at the end of the ''X-Men: Legacy'' tie-in.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #233</ref>\n* Unus and Feral are reanimated but should still be depowered as they were not mutants after M-day. Feral had her feline appearance restored prior to her death, and Unus was temporarily repowered by the Terrigen Mists, resulting in his death.\n* Cypher, using his power and assistance from Warlock and Magik, eradicated the techno-organic virus (effectively resurrecting himself).\n* Due to his nature, Proteus was able to separate himself from Destiny but was seemingly destroyed in a confrontation with Rogue and Magneto. Magneto doubts if the effects of dispersing Proteus' energy are permanent.\n\n==Collected editions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Material collected\n!Published date\n!ISBN\n|-\n|''Decimation: X-Men - The Day After''\n|''Decimation: House of M - The Day After,'' ''X-Men'' #177-181\n|May 2006\n|{{ISBN|0-7851-1984-1}}\n|-\n|''Decimation: Generation M''\n|''Generation M'' #1-5\n|July 2006\n|{{ISBN|0-7851-1958-2}}\n|-\n|''Decimation: Son of M''\n|''Son of M'' #1-6\n|August 2006\n|{{ISBN|0-7851-1970-1}}\n|-\n|''Decimation: Sentinel Squad O*N*E''\n|''Sentinel Squad O*N*E'' #1-5\n|September 2006\n|{{ISBN|0-7851-1997-3}}\n|-\n|''Decimation: X-Men - 198''\n|''X-Men: The 198'' #1-5 and ''X-Men: The 198 Files''\n|September 2006\n|{{ISBN|0-7851-1994-9}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=331|title=Decimation}}\n* [https://archive.today/20060320054017/http://www.marvel.com/comics/21 Marvel.com - Official Decimation webpage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060221234119/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showfaq.asp?fldAuto=287 UXN's \"Generation M\" issue summaries]\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Decimation (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Genoshans|Genoshan]]"}}}]}}}}
