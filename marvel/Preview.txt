The title was later shortened to simply ''New X-Men'' in 2006 when the new creative team of [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] took over the series with issue #20.\n\nWhereas the other ''X-Men'' comics mostly deal with established adult [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], this series concentrates on the lives of young students residing at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] as they learn to control their powers.\n\nAfter the 2007 crossover ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'', the ''New X-Men'' title was canceled and briefly relaunched as ''[[Young X-Men]]'' for 12 issues. The series was written by [[Marc Guggenheim]]. After the first arc of ''Young X-Men'', the characters began appearing in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''. With the cancellation of ''Young X-Men'' the characters were folded onto the main X-Men books, appearing most prominently in the pages of ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'', ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', and most recently, in ''[[X-Men (comic book)|X-Men]]''.\n\n==Founding==\n{{further|List of New X-Men story arcs}}\n\n''New X-Men'' begins where [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on the former ''[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]'' ended.

[[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] and [[X-23]] are incorporated into the roster of a new ''[[X-Force]]'' series. The characters are ultimately given a new home in the pages of ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'', written by [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] starting with ''X-Men: Legacy'' #226. Now a loose collection of students, the kids are led by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who serves as the team's teacher. Following the events of ''[[X-Men: Schism]]'', many of the New X-Men members follow [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] back East as he reopens the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] as a school and sanctuary for young mutants named the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. As of ''[[X-Men: Regenesis]]'', several additional X-Men join Rogue and Wolverine in serving as teachers for the young mutants: [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]]. The group has also accepted non-mutant members, such as [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] (a young [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] hatchling who is a pacifist) and Kid Gladiator, the son of [[X-Men]] enemy [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]. Another member of the student body is [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]], whose involvement with the school is involuntary in an effort to reform him.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' #1 (Released October 2011, Published December 2011)</ref>\n\n==Contributors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
