Swearing revenge, he created an armored suit containing flame-throwing equipment and taking the name \"The Scorcher\" he attacked his former place of employment. He ran afoul of [[Spider-Man]] on one of his first outings, and being defeated by the hero, he was sent to prison. Later, it was revealed that The Scorcher was not working alone but was an agent of [[Norman Osborn]] (who would later become the [[Green Goblin]]). Hudak eventually escaped prison to pursue an arson career but was defeated by Spider-Man a second time.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #14</ref>\n\nHe once attacked Christmas shoppers, only to be stopped by [[Ben Reilly]] who was acting as Spider-Man at the time (Ben noting that encountering the Scorcher after so long left him feeling particularly old).<ref>''Spider-Man: Holiday Special'' 1996</ref> Later, the second [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]] recruited Scorcher to join her incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-25</ref>\n\nWhen Matt Murdock's identity as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] was revealed, he and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] II moved to confront Murdock, but were driven off by Daredevil and Spider-Man. The Scorcher encountered Daredevil again in the [[Secret War (comics)|''Secret War'']] series when he was forced by [[Lucia von Bardas]] to band together with other supervillains and attack [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters which was defended by a dozen of New York's superheroes including Daredevil. Daredevil was instrumental in the criminal's personal defeat. Soon afterwards, Hudak promised his ex-wife he would give up his criminal life soon.\n\nThe [[Savage Land Mutates]] tried hiring the Scorcher to break [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] out of jail, but he refused. They weren't aware that Scorcher, trying to stay on the straight and narrow path after the Secret War, notified [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] about this contact (Due to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] having recently [[Avengers Disassembled|disbanded]]).<ref>''The New Avengers'' #5</ref> However, after some time Scorcher returned to the criminal life, but he was defeated by the [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''The Last Defenders'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Scorcher appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Scorcher, [[Living Laser]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and [[Razor Fist]] are sent by the Hood to retrieve [[Tigra]] and [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] after they flee from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].
