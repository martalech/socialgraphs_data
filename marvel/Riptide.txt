Having seen the results of Riptide's actions (Riptide's mutant power to launch barrages of sharp projectiles had enabled him to kill more Morlocks at any given single moment than any other Marauder), Colossus had been pushed close to his emotional breaking point. Colossus was further enraged and grieved when Riptide badly injured Nightcrawler, and finally snapped when [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]] maimed his former girlfriend, [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]]. Colossus lunged at Harpoon to mete out vengeance, but Riptide got in his way, believing that his power would fell the [[Russia]]n [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].
