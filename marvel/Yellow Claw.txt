Following his Nick Fury appearances, artists have depicted him with an unusual [[jaundice]]d-looking, yellowish skin tone, possibly as a side effect of his life extension elixirs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nThe Yellow Claw has dedicated himself to achieving world domination and supplanting [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He controls a worldwide criminal organization, along with a staff of research scientists and engineers. In 1942, the Yellow Claw encountered [[Lady Lotus]] in New York's Chinatown.<ref>''The Invaders'' #41 (Sept. 1979)</ref> In the 1950s, aided by his second-in-command, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war criminal]] Karl von Horstbaden, alias Fritz Voltzmann, the Claw forged a pact with [[Communist Chinese]] leaders including General Sung, whereby the Claw would seek to conquer the West for China. In fact, this was a ruse and he intended to conquer the world for himself. However, the Claw was continually foiled by FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]] and betrayed by his sole living relative, his grandniece Suwan, whom he could not bring himself to kill.<ref name=series>''Yellow Claw'' #1\u20134 (Oct. 1956 \u2013 April 1957)</ref>\n\nEventually, the Yellow Claw left the United States, placing the meddlesome Suwan in [[suspended animation]]. Decades later, after severing all of his ties with the People's Republic of China, the Claw fused Suwan's spirit with that of the conquest-minded ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] Princess Fan-le-tamen. After the Claw was later betrayed by the vengeful Suwan, he transferred the spirit of Fan-le-tamen to himself, which caused Suwan to crumble into dust, and he escaped.<ref>''Captain America'' #164\u2013167 (Aug.\u2013Nov. 1973)</ref> The Yellow Claw then took part in the Black Lama's War of the Super-Villains, apparently killing his major rival for world conquest the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] and battling the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #68\u201371, 75 and 77 (July\u2013Nov. 1974; June 1975; Aug. 1975)</ref> He then attempted to destroy New York City using a tidal wave, but his effort was thwarted by [[Nick Fury]] and the teenage superhero [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].<ref>''Nova'' #12\u201318 (Aug. 1977 \u2013 March 1978)</ref> A later plan to father sons by various genetically superior women, then sterilize mankind and rule the world, was foiled by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #204\u2013205 (Feb.\u2013March 1981)</ref> The Yellow Claw again attempted unsuccessfully to destroy New York City.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #31\u201332 (March\u2013May 1987)</ref> He later named the second [[Viper (Madame Hydra)#Madame Hydra VI|Madame Hydra]] as his new heir.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.''

All his schemes to \"conquer the world\" had the secondary purpose of giving Woo an Asian menace to fight against and establish his credentials as an American hero. However, the plan did not succeed, as Woo was simply promoted to a bureaucratic desk job. Dispirited, the Claw established the Atlas Foundation. After revealing the truth to Woo \u2013 who accepted the role of Khan in order to turn the Atlas Foundation and the secret Mongol dynasty into a force for good \u2013 Plan Chu, like all the previous Khans, allowed himself to be eaten by Mr. Lao, a powerful immortal dragon, ensuring that there could not be ''two'' Khans.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #6 (March 2007)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{unsourced section|date=February 2021}}\nThrough manipulation of the forces of magic, the Yellow Claw is able to create certain effects, including reanimating the dead. He also has the ability to psychically influence the sensory perceptions of others, enabling him to cast extremely realistic illusions. As a result of ingesting chemical elixirs, he has extended his life span; the Yellow Claw's extended life-span is dependent on the continued efficacy of his life-prolonging elixirs.\n\nThe Yellow Claw is an extraordinary genius with extensive knowledge in various sciences, particularly biochemistry and genetics. He is also proficient in robotics and has considerable knowledge of black magical lore. He is a master of Chinese martial arts and is an expert hand-to-hand combatant.\n\nThe Yellow Claw wears body armor and has access to various weapons as needed. He has access to specialized technology, including an id paralyzer that creates slaves subject to his telepathic control and a mind-amplification helmet that harnesses the psychic energies of his mind-slaves as a destructive force. He also has access to gigantic and hideously mutated creatures of his own design, created by biologists in his employ.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn an alternate universe in the late 1950s, the Yellow Claw recruited a team of superhuman minions and abducted President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].
