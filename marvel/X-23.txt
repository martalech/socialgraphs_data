The character was created by writer [[Craig Kyle]] for the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' television series in 2003, before debuting in the ''[[NYX (comics)|NYX]]'' comic series in 2004. Since then she has headlined two six-issue miniseries written by Kyle and [[Christopher Yost]], a one-shot and self-titled series written by [[Marjorie Liu]], and ''[[All-New Wolverine]]'' by [[Tom Taylor (writer)|Tom Taylor]].\n\nLaura was apparently the [[cloning|clone]] and later adoptive daughter of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], created to be the perfect killing machine. For years, she proved herself a capable assassin working for an organization called the Facility. A series of tragedies eventually led her to Wolverine and the X-Men. She attended school at the [[X-Mansion]], and eventually became a member of [[X-Force]]. It is revealed later that she is not a clone, but biological daughter of Wolverine. Like her father, Laura has a regenerative healing factor and enhanced senses, speed, and reflexes. She also has retractable [[adamantium]]-coated bone claws in her hands and feet. In 2015, the character succeeded her father in adopting the name and costume of Wolverine in the series ''All-New Wolverine''.<ref>[https://screenrant.com/xmen-x-23-still-wolverine-marvel-comic/ It's Official: The X-Men's X-23 is STILL Wolverine]</ref>\n\nThe character has appeared in adaptations, including animated film and TV series and video games. She was portrayed by [[Dafne Keen]] in the 2017 film ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]''.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:X23master.jpg|thumb|right|Promo shot for the \"X-23\" episode of ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''; the original design of Laura Kinney / X-23.]]\nLaura first appeared in season 3, episode 10 of the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated television series, titled \"X-23\",<ref name=\"Kubai\">{{cite web|last=Kubai|first=Andy L.|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-comic-book-universe-too-much-wolverine/|title=How Did The Marvel Universe End Up With (At Least) Four Wolverines?|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=November 28, 2017|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> voiced by [[Andrea Libman]].<ref name=\"cheatsheet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/logan-things-to-know-about-x-23.html/|title='Logan': 5 Things to Know About X-23|last=Yaniz Jr.|first=Robert|website=Showbiz Cheat Sheet|date=March 9, 2017|access-date=July 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405014944/https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/logan-things-to-know-about-x-23.html/|archive-date=April 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She was later voiced by [[Britt Irvin]] in season 4, episode 3, titled \"Target X\".\n\nLaura was created by [[Craig Kyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Roffman|first=Michael|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/03/x-23-creator-craig-kyle-has-a-pitch-for-a-logan-spinoff-thats-pretty-rad/|title=X-23 creator Craig Kyle has a pitch for a Logan spinoff that's pretty rad|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=March 8, 2017|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> He revealed that the character was his attempt to make a [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to \"connect more to the younger kids\", as while ''X-Men: Evolution'' was a reinvention of the X-Men making the characters teenagers, \"Wolverine was one of the old, grizzled guys\". The characterization went for the opposite of Wolverine, where instead of a man \"older than we know\" with no memory of his past and the life that he lost, Laura Kinney was a young girl \"shackled to the murders she's committed\" whose entire life revolved around the project that made her a killer.

The project is taken in a new direction: Dr. Martin Sutter recruits renowned mutant geneticist Dr. Sarah Kinney to develop a clone of Wolverine. Also on the team is Sutter's protege, [[Zander Rice|Dr. Zander Rice]], who was raised by Sutter after his father was killed by the original Weapon X.\n\nSince the only genetic sample from Weapon X is damaged, Kinney is unable to salvage the [[Y chromosome]]. Kinney proposes the creation of a female genetic twin. Her request is denied; Rice is opposed to the idea. After 22 failed attempts at reconstituting the DNA using a duplicate X chromosome, the 23rd sample yields a viable sample to combine with an [[embryo]]. Although Kinney is allowed to proceed, Rice exacts revenge for her insubordination by forcing her to act as the [[Surrogacy|surrogate]] mother of the specimen. For nine months, Kinney's every move is monitored. Finally, she gives birth to \"X-23\".<ref name=InnocenceLost>''X-23: Innocence Lost''. [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. Marvel Comics.

X-23 tracks the abductor to his apartment, kills him, and frees Megan. Kinney is fired when she returns and is escorted off the base. Shortly thereafter, Rice assigns X-23 to eliminate Sutter and his family. He orders her to keep it secret. X-23 reveals to Sarah that Rice is responsible for the murders. Before Kinney leaves, Rice reveals a chamber containing the incubation pods for subjects X-24 through X-50.<ref name=InnocenceLost/>\n\nKinney drafts a letter to her daughter, assigning her a final mission: destroy the pods and kill Rice.

After Laura and Megan part, Laura decides to confront the man who made her creation possible, Wolverine. Laura tracks Wolverine to Xavier's mansion and engages him in a battle, defeating him using tactics and maneuverability. She does not kill Wolverine, instead telling him why she came. Wolverine reveals that he is aware of Laura's ordeal, having received a detailed letter from her mother. The talk is then interrupted when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Captain America come to arrest Laura.<ref>''Target X'' #5.

There, they discover information on the Uni-Power that is being transferred to another facility. The Scorpion attempts to copy the information, but is stopped by Laura.

The portal prevents any organic matter traveling through it. This leads Cable to sacrifice himself, allowing his techno-organic virus to overwhelm him, forcing the portal open and making it possible for the team to return to Utopia.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn the fallout of \"Second Coming\", Wolverine cuts Laura from the team, explaining to her that after a lifetime of following orders from others, she needs to learn to make her own choices and follow her own path.<ref>X-Men: Second Coming #3</ref> Laura subsequently tracks former Weapon X scientist Detlef Metzger, intending to capture him before he can perform experiments using a vial of Wolverine's blood.

She replies by asking if there is any other choice.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While she thinks about what choice she will make, Laura goes for a walk with Jubilee and asks her why she chose Cyclops' side. Jubilee tells her she chose to stay with Cyclops because, as a vampire, she can hear the heartbeat of everyone around her, and it makes her hungry and wants to eat them. Laura tells her that she will not hurt them but Jubilee tells her that the urge is there and that she needs to fight as much she needs blood. She cannot be with Wolverine because she is afraid to violate his new philosophy: if you are a kid you do not fight, and he sees her as a kid. Jubilee tells Laura that Logan sees her the same way, they both agree that it sucks. Laura's phone rings as the others need an answer, but they ignore it and Jubilee tells Laura to go and have some fun and dance. Laura explains that she cannot dance, but Jubilee tells her it does not matter because she is hot. Laura tells her she is not hot. However, as they go, someone follows them. While Jubilee was dancing, Laura becomes distracted by looking at someone and recognized him as the person who took over Zebra Daddy's operation. She and Jubilee attack him and his men and take the girl who was with him since she knew where the other girls were and how to free them. As they think about what to do with the girls, because they cannot just call the police, the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents appear and take the girls to help them. Natasha offers Laura to come to the [[Avengers Academy]] and she accepts. The next day she tells Logan what happened, and Wolverine tells her he is going to miss her and he is sorry he could not do better by her.

Marvel Comics.</ref> She is amnesiac and being hunted by the [[Purifiers (comics)|Purifiers]].\n\nAfter being found by Kitty, Laura was taken to their base to recover. When Laura wakes up, with her memories now returning, at the former Weapon X facility she immediately tries to escape. Teen Cyclops goes to talk to her, while he's gone Teen Jean mentions to the team that Teen Cyclops \"fancies\" Laura. As Laura makes it outside she's met by Teen Cyclops, who was waiting for her. Teen Cyclops tries to calm her down but Laura only ceases hostility after getting Teen Cyclops scent and figuring out that Teen Cyclops is who he says he is.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe two talk, with Laura telling him that she doesn't want to talk about her past or what happened to her. Suddenly Teen Cyclops awkwardly hugs her, when she was distracted and looking sad, because he thought she needed a hug. Laura tells him that she doesn't do hugs, especially not with an audience as Kitty, Teen Jean, and Teen Beast were watching them. Teen Jean expressed a very conflicted look upon her face due to the hug and having read part of Laura's mind, thus she knows what happened in ''Avengers Arena''. Laura thanks them for helping her and suggests they take the fight to the Purifiers, but in order for her to track them down, they'll have to return her to where they found her.{{issue|date=October 2016}}\n\nUpon finding the Purifier base they immediately set out to attack them.

Consequently, her mutant powers are similar to his. Like Wolverine, Laura's primary mutant ability is an accelerated healing factor that allows her to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissues with far greater speed, efficiency, and finality than ordinary humans are capable of. Injuries such as gunshot wounds, slashes, and puncture wounds completely heal within a matter of seconds. She has also been shown to be able to reattach limbs; for example, she reattached her hand after she severed it to escape the restraints placed on her by [[Kimura (comics)|Kimura]].<ref name=X-23:TargetX>''X-23: Target X''. Marvel Comics.</ref> The effects of her accelerated healing powers extend to her body's [[immune system]], rendering her immune to disease and infection. She is also immune to most drugs and toxins, although she can be affected by certain drugs if given sufficient dosage. [[Biological immortality|Given the regenerative nature of her cells, she is potentially-immortal]], just like her father.{{issue|date=March 2017}}\n\nLaura's mutant healing factor heightened her physical senses, speed, agility, reflexes/reactions, balance, and endurance to superhuman levels. Like Wolverine, Laura possesses retractable claws sheathed within her forearms. She releases the claws through the tissue of her knuckles, leaving small wounds which are healed by her healing factor. Unlike Wolverine, however, Laura has only two claws per hand which are her primary weapons of offence. She also possesses a single, retractable claw housed within each foot which she tends to use for defense. The claws were forcefully extracted by Zander Rice, sharpened, coated with [[adamantium]], and reinserted into her body. Laura escaped before the procedure to fuse her entire skeleton with adamantium could be performed.<ref name=X-23:TargetX/> Since the claws are laced with adamantium, they are virtually unbreakable and are capable of cutting almost any substance.\n\nIn addition to her own innate powers and skills, Laura has twice been the host of the [[Enigma Force (comics)|Enigma Force]], providing her with many special abilities particular to the entity. She is the first mutant to be chosen by the entity as its host, as well as being one of a handful of individuals to do so more than once. At the end of their second encounter, the Enigma Force named Laura as the heir to its power.<ref name= \"X-23_16\">''X-23'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> This permanent association was first indicated by a mark appearing on the palm of her right hand at the conclusion of the \"Killing Dream\" arc of her solo series.<ref name=\"X-23_3\">''X-23'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBorn and raised in captivity, Laura has been trained to become a living weapon. She is highly trained in the use of long range weapons and explosives and is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with intensive training in numerous armed and unarmed [[martial arts]] techniques. She has also been subjected to conditioning in which a specific \"trigger scent\" has been used to send her into a berserker rage, killing anything in sight; [[Emma Frost]] is unsure if this will ever be fully suppressed. She has displayed fluency in [[French language|French]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and Zander Rice once described her intellect as being \"off the charts\".\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Wolverine===\nLaura and Logan talk and interact with each other in ways that are consistent with a father-daughter relationship (even though in ''New X-Men'', Logan introduced her to the students as his sister). Logan acts protectively towards Laura and seems to have her well-being at heart, such as when he openly voiced his disapproval of Cyclops putting her on X-Force; he, however, did not force her to leave, though he told Gambit that he thinks he should have. When the pair first meet, Logan offers to help her start over at the Xavier Institute and says that he knows better than anyone what she is going through. Iron Man's recent research confirmed that Logan is actually Laura's biological father, rather than just being a female clone of Logan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/wolverine-daughter-x23-clone-origin/|title = X-23 is Wolverine's Daughter, Not a Clone|website = [[Screen Rant]]|date = 14 August 2018}}</ref> After Logan's death, Laura officially adopts his codename of 'Wolverine' to honor his memory.\n\n===Sarah Kinney===\nSarah was the first one to show Laura any sort of affection in spite of her orders from the Facility to not treat her like a child. Sarah would frequently read her ''Pinocchio'' as a child and showed concern when she noticed the cuts Laura inflicted on herself. It took Laura sparing the life of Henry Sutter for Sarah to realize that she was just as guilty of using Laura as the rest of the Facility was. Deciding to make things right, Sarah hatched a plan to escape with Laura, destroy the Facility's work, and start over with her. However, thanks to Zander Rice lacing the trigger scent on her, Sarah was killed by Laura. With her dying breaths, Sarah tells \"X-23\" her name is Laura. Sarah's final thoughts were left in a letter to Laura detailing her guilt, that she was Laura's mother, and the realization that she had come to love her. Sarah's death remains to this day the life that Laura regrets taking the most. Iron Man's recent research confirmed that Sarah is actually Laura's biological mother, rather than just being a surrogate. Writer [[Marjorie Liu]] has stated that she intended for Laura to be part [[Asian people|Asian]] through her mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/marjoriemliu/status/738359565620744193 |title=Marjorie Liu statement |date=June 2, 2016 |author=Liu, Marjorie |archive-date=20 March 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190320205350/https://twitter.com/marjoriemliu/status/738359565620744193 |access-date=20 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Megan Kinney===\nLaura's cousin on her mother's side. After escaping from the Facility Laura moved in with Sarah's sister Debbie and her daughter Megan. For a time the two connected and Megan even admitted to Laura being her best friend. However, when Facility agents came to take Laura back, Laura helped them escape and make new identities so that they could hide. Laura and Megan then went their separate ways and have not heard from each other since, though Megan remains one of the people closest to Laura's heart. In the 18th issue of ''All-New Wolverine'', after killing Kimura by drowning her, Laura finds Megan's hideout and says they (Megan and Debbie) don't have to hide anymore.\n\n===Kiden Nixon===\nA homeless mutant from New York City. Laura and Kiden met each other when Laura was a prostitute under the pimp Zebra Daddy. Kiden helped Laura to escape from her life as a prostitute and quickly befriended her though at this point Laura had difficulty speaking. Laura recounts in the ''X-23 One Shot'', that Kiden and her friends did not know or care that she was a weapon. To them, Laura was their friend and part of their gang. Laura parts ways with them at the end of the one shot, returning with Wolverine. They leave on good terms, and Kiden says that Laura will always have a place with them.\n\n===Hellion===\nThe first boy that Laura formed a crush on. At first [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] was hostile towards her, but during the ''[[Mercury Rising]]'' arc the two grew closer. [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] managed to pick up on Laura's feelings towards him though she did not get Laura to admit to it. Over time Hellion/Julian began to feel the same way, though their relationship never managed to get much further. When Julian lost his hands during ''Second Coming'', Laura stayed by him, watching him recover. After the ''Misadventures in Babysitting'' arc Laura ended things between her and Julian saying that she no longer felt the same way towards him.\n\n===Gambit===\n[[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] traveled with Laura during the ''X-23'' solo series. The two became friends and looked out for one another as Gambit helped her to cope with the changes in her life as well as giving her helpful life advice. He affectionately referred to her as \"Petite\" and even managed to get her to calm down from a trigger scent-induced rage. Gambit scolded Logan for not protecting Laura the way he protected [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], to which Logan admitted to his failings as Laura's father. Gambit also went on to remark that Laura, while damaged, was far from being broken, contrary to everyone's perceptions of her. If Laura was truly broken she would not be trying to change. Logan later on thanked Gambit for succeeding with Laura where he failed. When Laura left to join to the Avengers Academy, she and Gambit shared a goodbye hug and he told her wherever she went she was not alone.\n\n===Jubilee===\nDuring the ''Touching Darkness'' arc of the ''X-23'' series, Gambit had Wolverine come by to help Laura. Logan had brought [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] with him and Laura attacked her on sight due to her being a vampire. Though after getting some space between the two girls things managed to calm down. Laura had some jealousy towards Jubilee from the ''X-23'' one shot as Logan treated her more like a daughter than he did her. Laura tried to bait Jubilee into killing her by slicing her neck open and counting on her bloodlust, though Jubilee managed to stop herself after witnessing one of Laura's memories. After talking things out, the two realized how much alike they were and became friends.\n\n===Daken===\nLogan/Wolverine's son and the closest thing Laura has to a brother. [[Daken]] is to Laura what [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] is to Wolverine, her opposite. Even though Laura admits that she and Daken are related by blood, the two do not initially see each other as family. Laura had fought with Daken when the [[Dark Avengers]] under [[Norman Osborn]] invaded Utopia. They did not truly meet until Laura and Gambit came to [[Madripoor]] looking to track down [[Malcolm Colcord]]. At first Daken does not believe that she is a clone of his father, until Laura reveals her claws. Daken berates her for coming to Madripoor and remarks that they are nothing alike. The two square off until Daken decides to offer his assistance, which Laura rejects. When Daken confronts Colcord about his plans to restart Weapon X, he reveals his subterfuge at leading Laura and Gambit to Colcord, though this turns out be a ruse as well, as he incapacitates Gambit and helps Colcord capture Laura. Daken learns about Laura's past from Colcord and assists in her escape from her cell. He remarks that Laura is a construct, to which Laura retorts that he is just like her: Just like the Facility made Laura into a weapon, so did Romulus do to Daken, to which he responds that he owns his own fate. The two then enter a brief mutual alliance to destroy Colcord's new project. Before they part ways, Daken asks Laura why she does not seek power when she could easily have it. Laura remarks that what she has to prove has nothing to do with power, and then asks Daken why he seeks more power when he already has it. Daken remarks that power is all he has. Laura's encounter with Daken makes her realize that she owns her fate and can do with it what she wants. Daken does not seem to have the same hate towards Laura that he does with Logan, and by the time of later series such as ''Wolverines'', he even begins to demonstrate affection towards her. In ''Reign of X'' and later stories, he actively refers to Laura as his sister along with Gabby.\n\n===Angel===\nPrior to the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Laura began a relationship with the time-displaced teenaged [[Warren Worthington III]], which persisted after she took on the Wolverine codename. However, Warren clashed with her several times about her increasing recklessness. Following a brutal beating she received from [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], he decided to end the relationship to make a point about the unnecessary risks she was taking. The two, however, reconciled after having come to understand each other's feelings.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' Vols. 1 and 2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Psylocke (Betsy Braddock)===\nLaura and [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] became quite friendly with each other on their first meeting in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #456, shortly after Psylocke came back to life. Both girls seemed to share an enjoyment in fighting. In one instance, Laura was knocked out while Psylocke continued, upon awakening Laura saw all the enemies had disappeared and when she asked Psylocke what happened, Betsy joked that she ate them, to which Laura replied it was cool. Another shared moment was when Betsy and Laura discussed her coming back to life, which Laura didn't see as unique since she herself had died repeatedly when she was experimented on to test her healing factor, but she always \"got better\".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #457. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Psylocke asked how that made her feel, Laura smiled and said she killed them, and they didn't get better. Betsy then smiled and wrapped her arm around Laura's shoulder, saying she had some very definite possibilities. There have also been images of Laura imitating Betsy, including braiding her hair and mimicking her poses.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #458. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Gabby Kinney===\nIn the first arc of ''All-New Wolverine'' Laura learned that Alchemax genetics had created ten clones of her. All but four of the clones died in captivity, either during training or as a result of tests of a nanotech weapon that was slowly breaking down their bodies. Two others died during the escape; one who committed suicide after Laura foiled her attempt to assassinate Robert Chandler's son, and a second killed by Chandler's lead enforcer. The last two Sisters \u2014 [[Gabby Kinney|Gabby]] and Bellona \u2014 survived.<ref>''All-New Wolverine'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Laura took Gabby in and adopted her as her sister, taking it upon herself to give her the family Laura herself never had with Logan, in hopes of helping her find the right path. Much like Laura, Gabby possesses a regenerative healing factor and bone claws, however she only has a single claw in each hand. Additionally, as a result of the nanites in her blood Gabby does not feel pain. She eventually adopted a super-hero code name, [[Honey Badger]], given by her brother [[Daken]].<ref>''All-New Wolverine'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> She eventually gave the name up to become Scout.<ref>''X-23'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nChase Magnett of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' stated, \"Laura Kinney relinquishes the role of Wolverine this week and returns to her original title as X-23. Ever since she was introduced under this guise in the animated series X-Men: Evolution, Laura has been a popular character amongst X-fans. While she has not even been in Marvel Comics for 15 years, she has racked up a long list of series featuring plenty of great stories in that time.

The Evolutionaries, an occult and scientific group, had been using mutants in order for one of them to become a vessel for Mephicton (fusion of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and Chthon). However, this process always resulted in the mutants death. Seeing that their plan was failing, the group's leaders, Sarah Kinney and Herbert Wyndham decided to conceive a flawed child to act as the perfect vessel for the demon. However, Sara raised Laura and told her about empathy and humanity, while Herbert wanted the girl to be a weapon. At the age of seventeen, Laura along with Hellhound (fusion of [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]) were sent on missions.

An elderly Laura has passed on the Wolverine identity to Gabby, and has learned that a genetic defect will soon lead to her death. While initially content to live out the remainder of her life in peace, Laura is spurred back into action when she learns Bellona is being held captive by Doctor Doom (the only villain still active). Laura leads a strike team into Latveria to rescue Bellona, but is captured by Doom.
