Rebelling against the scientists responsible for his transformation, Rhino used his newfound powers to become a successful criminal, and soon clashed with superheroes like [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Hulk]]. The character is typically portrayed as a dimwitted brute, capable of great destruction, but ultimately easily deceived.\n\nOne of Spider-Man's most prominent adversaries, the Rhino has been adapted into various forms of media since his original debut during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], including [[animated television series]] and [[video game]]s.

The character returned in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968), and although he apparently died at the end of the story, he was revived in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #124 (Feb. 1970), becoming a perennial opponent of both Spider-Man and the Hulk.\n\nThe character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over 12 titles. Significant appearances included starring in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1\u20134 (May\u2013Aug. 1991); the \"[[Flowers for Rhino]]\" storyline in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' #5\u20136 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 2001), which is told from the character's perspective; and ''Punisher War Journal'' (vol. 2) #13\u201315 (Jan.\u2013March 2008), in which Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle. He has also been a member of multiple supervillain teams, including the [[Emissaries of Evil]], the [[Sinister Syndicate]], and the [[Sinister Six]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n=== Origin and early villainy ===\nAleksei Sytsevich was a member of the [[Russian mafia]] who willingly underwent a series of chemical and radiation treatments meant to give him an artificial skin covering that would grant superhuman strength. After successfully completing the treatment, Sytsevich rebelled against the [[Eastern Bloc]] agents who gave him these powers, destroying their laboratory. He was subsequently hired to kidnap [[Colonel]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and obtain the extraterrestrial [[spore]]s to which Jameson was exposed during a space mission, but Sytsevich was defeated by the superhero [[Spider-Man]] and taken to prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #41\u201343 (Oct. \u2013 Dec. 1966)</ref>\n\nAfter serving his sentence, the Rhino was approached by the same scientists for more augmentation. This time, they used the same [[gamma radiation]] that granted the [[Hulk]] his abilities to further increase the Rhino's strength. They also equipped him with a more durable, acid-proof suit that would further increase his abilities. The Rhino agreed to find and kidnap Bruce Banner, the Hulk's human [[alter ego]], for his knowledge of gamma radiation. Despite the Rhino's training and equipment, he was easily defeated by the Hulk, who placed him in a [[coma]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #104 (June 1968)</ref>\n\nMonths later, the Rhino was revived by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], who planned to interrupt Banner's wedding to [[Betty Ross]].

His incredible speed allows him to run at high velocities, especially over short distances. Sytsevich frequently \"charges\" his opponents in this manner, enabling him to cause great harm to most enemies in the surrounding area. He is, however, notorious for his lack of agility and slow reaction time, which makes it difficult for him to change direction when running at high speeds. As such, his fighting style is focused more on melee attacks.\n\n===Rhino suit===\nSytsevich possesses a thick [[polymer]] suit that resembles the physique of a [[rhinoceros]], including two horns, and covers everything but his face. The suit is resistant to damage and extreme temperatures and these horns are capable of penetrating two-inch plate steel. His first, cruder suit was originally bonded to his skin in the aftermath of a rocket crash and he went through several attempts to have the suit removed.\n\nAfter the first suit's destruction, Justin Hammer created a second, removable iteration. The second suit allows Sytsevich to withstand high caliber bullets, thermal attacks, and most impact forces. It also further increases his strength and durability.\n\n==Other characters named Rhino==\n===Doctor Tramma's Rhino===\nWhen Aleksei Sytsevich declines Doctor Tramma's offer to return to the Rhino role, Tramma finds another subject and equips him with a high-tech suit that was supposed to be given to Sytsevich. The second Rhino comes after Sytsevich, feeling that he had to destroy the original Rhino if he was going to [[Rapture|ascend]]. Spider-Man defeats the second Rhino, who then escapes.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #617\"/>\n\nWhile lifting a makeshift dumbbell made out of a pole and two trucks, the second Rhino is called up by a mysterious person telling him where he can find Sytsevich. Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s press meetings. Aleksei lies to the second Rhino, agreeing to fight him in his Rhino suit, but instead goes into hiding with his wife Oksana. Before they arrive at their safehouse, however, the second Rhino attacks again, and Oksana dies as a result. Aleksei dons his old Rhino suit, which is strong enough to destroy the new Rhino's, and kills the unnamed wearer.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #625\"/>\n\n===Ultimate Rhino===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the Rhino is '''Alex O'Hirn''', a scientist who uses a suit of armor known as R.H.I.N.O. (Robotism Heuristic Intelligence Navigable Operative), stolen from the United States military. Using the armor's strength, O'Hirn robs a Manhattan bank by charging the vault-head first. He then rampages through a busy city street. The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] tries to escape school in order to confront O'Hirn, but cannot get there in time, and the R.H.I.N.O. is defeated by [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #28.
