She first appeared in ''[[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]]'' #31 as the main antagonist of [[X-23|Laura Kinney/X-23]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was created by writers [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] as well as artist [[Michael Choi (comics)|Mike Choi]]. Her first appearance was in ''New X-Men'' #31 (Dec. 2006). She was introduced as the [[villain]]ous handler of X-23.<ref>James Egan; ''1000 Facts about Superheroes vol. 3'' - page: 126</ref> The name [[Kimura]] (\u6728\u6751) is a [[List of common Japanese surnames|common Japanese surname]], and means \"tree village\".\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Origin===\nKimura was born to an abusive alcoholic father and a negligent mother. Her school life was similar, as she was abused and tormented by her peers. Through unspecified means and at some point in time, Kimura's grandmother was her caregiver. At once, her grandmother tried to heal the emotional damage inflicted upon Kimura through nurturing, love, and understanding. But by that point in time the emotional scars were permanent and her grandmother's attempts to reach her were futile. After her grandmother's fatal heart attack, Kimura took off, eventually coming into contact with the Facility. She then underwent some unspecified procedure that granted her physical invulnerability, density control, and reconstruction. She then exacted revenge against those in her past who had wronged her. During her time at the Facility, Kimura eventually assumed the same abusive role as the people who victimized her in the past, particularly to Laura Kinney.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #31</ref><ref name=CBR1/>\n\n===The Facility===\nAs an agent of the Facility, Kimura became [[X-23]]'s handler. She abused X-23, finding any excuse to bully, regardless of whether X-23 failed or not. After X-23 escaped the Facility, Kimura made it her duty to track down X-23, bring back to the Facility, and kill anyone X-23 has come in contact with.<ref>''X-23: Target X'' #4</ref>\n\nShe eventually tracks X-23 to San Francisco, where Laura is living with Aunt Debbie and cousin Megan. During a raid on Debbie's house, Kimura breaks X-23's neck. She then uses adamantium handcuffs to handcuff herself to Laura and her downstairs to Debbie and Megan where she threatens and begins to put her finger through Megan's heart. Laura recovers from these injuries, cuts off her own hand and handcuffs Kimura to a pipe. Laura tells Megan and Debbie to get her duffel bag and take what's absolutely needed and have 3 minutes to leave the house. Laura reattaches her own hand while Kimura says that everyone Laura loves will die and that she will be the one who kills them. Laura cuts open a gas pipe and turns on the light, causing an explosion.<ref>''X-23: Target X'' #5</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/x-23-logan-most-wtf-insane-moments-comics/|title=Logan: 15 Most WTF Things X-23 Has Ever Done|date=2017-02-26|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/badass-x-23-moments/jason-robbins?page=2|title=23 Times X-23 Was an Even More Savage Wolverine Than Logan|website=Ranker|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Encounter with the New X-Men===\nEventually tracking X-23 to the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], Kimura proceeds to lure her target out in the open so that she can capture, but it turns out that Kimura is actually after [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] whom she easily captures. She and X-23 fight but she injures Laura and gets away with Mercury.<ref>''New X-Men: Childhood's End'' vol. 4 #33</ref>\n\nWhen she arrives back at the Facility, she watches as they perform experiments on Mercury and eventually unleash their new creation [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]] upon the mutant [[Mammomax]] much to her pleasure.<ref>''New X-Men: Childhood's End'' vol. 4 #34</ref> X-23 and [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] set out to rescue Mercury and track Kimura to the Facility and confront her. Hellion manages to subdue her and Laura tells Hellion to kill her but refuses, using [[telekinesis]] to fire her into the air and miles away.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nKimura eventually makes her way back to the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning and makes another attempt to kill X-23. [[Emma Frost]] detects her and telepathically subdues her, revealing Kimura's history of child abuse and neglect at the hands of her parents and peers. Frost tells Kimura that she is nothing but a bully who harms others like Laura despite knowing how painful it is to make up for her own abusive childhood. Frost then mind-wipes her, making her forget about her grandmother\u2014the only influential and positive person in her life\u2014creating \"a deep void that will cause [her] pain for a lifetime.\" Frost then implants telepathic instructions in Kimura's mind to make her hunt down the Facility's leaders, particularly Professor Harkins, who oversaw Mercury's experimentation.<ref>''New X-Men: Childhood's End'' vol. 4 #36</ref> After going through 6 months of getting her brain rewired to stop Frost's psychic command, Kimura begins selling clones of Predator X for the Facility. She later encounters Wolverine and The [[Punisher]] during a transaction with [[Madame Hydra]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 2 #2</ref> The two manage to stop her, though she eventually escapes.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\n===X-Force===\nKimura returns after [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] captures X-23 and bring back to the Facility. Her brutality only seems to have increased as she cuts off Laura's arm with a small chainsaw for \"being a bad girl\" but X-23 then uses the trigger scent to her advantage and escapes with Agent Alisande Morales's help.<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref> X-23 manages to escape, causing Kimura to be enraged. Kimura threatens to find Laura's aunt and cousin Megan to kill in retaliation.<ref>''X-Force'' #19-20</ref>\n\n===''All-New Wolverine''===\nKimura is seen in ''[[All-New Wolverine]]'', being responsible for helping the four sisters (X-23's clones) escape [[Alchemax]]. She made a deal with Bellona (the white haired X-23 clone) to exchange the nanites within Bellona's body killing her, for her help escaping and destroying Alchemax's genetics division.<ref>''All-New Wolverine'' #6</ref> She is killed by X-23 by being pinned down and drowned in water.<ref name=CBR1/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicnewbies.com/2017/03/13/all-new-wolverine-kills-kimura/|title = All New Wolverine Kills Kimura|date = 13 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-laura-kinney-overcomes-spoiler/|title = After 12 Years, the All-New Wolverine Finally Overcomes &#91;SPOILER&#93;|date = 9 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\nKimura's main characteristic is her [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] towards others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-laura-kinney-overcomes-spoiler/|title=After 12 Years, The All-New Wolverine Finally Overcomes [SPOILER]|date=2017-02-09|website=CBR|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multiversitycomics.com/reviews/x-force-not-forgotten/|title = \"X-Force: Not Forgotten\" and Doing it All|date = 14 September 2019}}</ref> As a character she has been presented in the comics as the one character X-23 has never been able to truly defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/21176-marvel-comics-full-august-2014-solicitations.html|title=Marvel Comics FULL AUGUST 2014 SOLICITATIONS|website=Newsarama|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nKimura has indestructible skin, strong enough to withstand anything from grenade blasts to adamantium blades.
