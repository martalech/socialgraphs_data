He first appeared in ''[[Superman]]'' #167 (February 1964), and was created by [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Cary Bates]], and [[Curt Swan]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHe is the heir of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], one of [[Superman]]'s greatest foes. He is an ancestor of Querl Dox, [[Brainiac 5]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Vril Dox first appeared in ''[[Superman]]'' #167 (February 1964), by [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Cary Bates]], and [[Curt Swan]], in a story entitled \"The Deadly Duo! - The Team of Luthor and Brainiac!\". He was later resurrected in ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'' #1 (January 1989), by [[Keith Giffen]], [[Bill Mantlo]], and [[Todd McFarlane]]. However, rather than being the adopted son of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], due to changes in Post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' continuity, he is now a clone of Brainiac.\n\nHe went on to star in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '89'' (February 1989) through ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' (September 1994) by [[Keith Giffen]], [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], and [[Barry Kitson]]. He returned in the follow-up series ''R.E.B.E.L.S. '94'' (October 1994) through ''R.E.B.E.L.S. '96'' (March 1996) by [[Tom Peyer]] and Arnie Jorgensen, and the subsequent series ''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (2009\u20132011).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Silver Age===\nVril Dox was a young [[Coluan]] who was [[adopted]] by the Computer Tyrants of Colu and declared Brainiac's son (Brainiac 2). He escaped and led a rebellion against the Computer Tyrants which overthrew their rule.{{efn|As seen in ''Superman'' #167 (February 1964)}} He later appeared briefly in the ''Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes'' miniseries. His descendants (who had inherited long Coluan lifespans) were his son Pran Dox (Brainiac 3), his grandson Kajz Dox (Brainiac 4) and ultimately his great-grandson Querl Dox, [[Brainiac 5]] of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]].{{efn|As seen in ''Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #2 (1979)}}\n\n===Post-Crisis===\n====''Invasion!''====\n{{main|Invasion! (DC Comics)}}\nVril Dox II is a now a clone of Vril Dox (Brainiac), rather than his adopted son, as he is created by Vril Dox himself. He is still regarded as Brainiac's \"[[heir]]\", as he has inherited the original's high intelligence and [[Machiavelli]]an ethics.\n\n====''L.E.G.I.O.N. '89-94''====\n{{main|L.E.G.I.O.N.}}\nVril Dox is the founder of the interplanetary police force [[L.E.G.I.O.N.|Licensed Extra Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network]] (abbreviated as L.E.G.I.O.N., an acronym suggested by Strata but accepted by Dox). It was founded through outright murder when Vril and his allies destroyed a criminal drug ring. Chief Dox tries to manipulate everyone he came across, not generally accepting when they did not follow his plans. He manages to gain control of the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. This is partly by outsmarting and outfighting Lobo and taking advantage of one of the bounty hunter's simple ethics; that he never breaks his word.\n\nVril leads the Earth's heroes in the 1992 ''Annual'' crossover, they travel to the moon and defeat the [[Eclipso]] entity.\n\n====''R.E.B.E.L.S. '94-96''====\n{{main|R.E.B.E.L.S.}}\nVril had a son named Lyrl Dox (Brainiac 3) who rebelled and took over his organization. Vril later regains control of L.E.G.I.O.N by bartering with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. The deal is for the soul of one of his unborn offspring.  After the cancellation of the title, he would only occasionally appear in the more cosmic DCU titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cosmicteams.com/legion/l-e-g-i-o-n/vrildox.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928020538/http://cosmicteams.com/legion/l-e-g-i-o-n/vrildox.htm |archive-date=2010-09-28 |title=L.E.G.I.O.N.: Vril Dox II/Brainiac 2}}</ref> For example, he appears in the [[Adam Strange#Planet Heist|2004 Adam Strange miniseries]], using robotic soldiers to hunt Strange. Dox, now missing his hair, incorrectly believes Rann had been destroyed at the hands of Strange. Dox's forces assist in the limited series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.\n\n====''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (2009\u20132011)====\nA new 2009 series features [[Starro]] the Conqueror taking control of a now completely automated L.E.G.I.O.N. Dox, along with his old compatriot, Strata, must form a new team to regain his former status. During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Dox comes into contact with the mother of his son, who had recently been killed by L.E.G.I.O.N. drones, and was subsequently revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. Dox was also in an area in which a [[Sinestro Corps]] member was murdered by another Black Lantern. When the ring started to search for a new host, it selected Dox, making him a member of the Sinestro Corps.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' vol. 2 #10. DC Comics.</ref> However, not even the power of the ring was a match for the Black Lanterns, forcing Dox to teleport them to [[Starro]]'s homeworld, despite the fact that his son, Lyrl (who had recently had his intelligence restored by the warlord) was there also. Soon after, the ring rejected Dox, who had repeatedly refused [[Sinestro]]'s mandate that all members of the Sinestro Corps were to gather at Korugar, and declared that he had been discharged from the Corps.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' vol. 2 #11. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nR.E.B.E.L.S. helped to save the Vega system and several galaxies by defeating Starro the Conqueror. The plight of Rann's people was soon resolved by Vril Dox, seeking to restore his reputation after [[Starro]] the Conqueror stole L.E.G.I.O.N. from him and used it to enslave its client worlds. Dox Zeta-beamed Rann into the Vega system, in the orbit previously held by the now destroyed planet [[Tamaran]], and proceeded to terraform Rann and make it suitable to sustain life again.\n\nThe restoration of the planet Rann was not Dox's only reason for relocating it into the Vega system. First, by putting [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]] into Tamaran's orbit, it restored the gravitational balance to the Vega system, which had been thrown off by Tamaran's destruction. Secondly, in exchange for restoring their planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.\n\nTamaranian refugees, led by [[Blackfire (DC Comics)|Blackfire]], attacked Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran's orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off-world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. As it turned out, Dox was off-world negotiating an official end to the [[Rann-Thanagar War]], using Rann's new-found distance from Thanagar and change in leadership on both sides as leverage.\n\nDox then went on to mediate the tension between the Rannians and the Tamaranians by proposing that the Tamaranians live on Rann's uninhabited southern continent.\n\nDox, [[Adam Strange]] and other senior commanders of L.E.G.I.O.N. also ensured peace with the Green Lantern Corps and helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaranians and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega system and the galaxy, with Dox becoming consort to Blackfire.\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn 2011, \"[[The New 52]]\" rebooted the DC universe. In ''Superman'' vol. 3 Annual #2 Vril Dox is shown to be Brainiac's original identity.<ref>''Superman'' vol. 3 Annual #2 (September 2013). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\nIn 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called \"[[DC Rebirth]]\", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to \"The New 52\". When Brainiac's home planet of Colu falls under the threat of four beings that escaped the Source Wall at the end of ''Dark Nights: Metal'', the teams of heroes and villains realize that their armor is pulling them into four teams towards four different energy sources in the form of trees that coincide with the four entities. Batman's team finds Vril Dox, who claims that his father would never put his faith in the Earth heroes, as he only needed their powers to save Colu, but his plan required him at every step. With Brainiac's death at the hands of Amanda Waller, the planet of Colu and Earth are doomed.<ref>''Justice League: No Justice'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nVril is visited by the time-traveling entity named Waverider, a man on a mission to see which modern-day heroic figure might become a tyrant in ten years' time. This is part of the ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover. Vril captures Waverider and does see his future. Due to power gained by ten years of Waverider's capture, Vril has become a tyrant, killing many innocents. Horrified at this, Vril lets Waverider go so that this future will not come to pass.<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' Annual #2 (1991).
