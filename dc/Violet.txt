Bivolo''') is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[comic books]] by [[DC Comics]]. His real name is a pun based on the acronym \"[[ROYGBIV]]\" (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet, pronounced ''roy-gee-bihv''), a mnemonic for the colors of a [[rainbow]]. He is a minor, though recurring, enemy of [[the Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]] and other heroes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=Hero-a-go-go!

Bivolo===\nAs a child, '''Roy G. Bivolo''' always dreamed of a career as an artist, a lofty goal considering he was completely [[colorblind]]. He would often paint what he thought were beautiful pieces of art, and indeed showed great technical skill, only to be told that it was made up of clashing colors. His father, an [[optometrist]] and genius in optical technology, swore he would find a cure for his son's disorder. Due to failing health, he was unable to complete his product, but instead created a sophisticated pair of goggles that would allow Roy to create beams of solid rainbow-colored light. On his death-bed, his father presents him with this gift, and it was not long before Roy found a sinister use for it.\n\nTurning to crime because the world did not appreciate his art, Roy, now the Rainbow Raider, went on a crime spree focused mostly on art galleries, saying that if he could not appreciate the great works of art in them (due to his disability), then no one else would. During this time he often clashes with the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and sparks a rivalry that would last several years. Some years later he would fight [[Booster Gold]] as well. Rainbow Raider becomes the mind-addled slave of a crimelord in one of many alternate futures within the ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' storyline.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) Annual #4 (1991). DC Comics.</ref> He is a central plot point in the first issue of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline because even [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], the demonic antagonist, considered him pathetic, indeed even calling him a \"[[paramecium]]\".<ref>''Underworld Unleashed'' #1 (November 1995). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nRainbow Raider once traded opponents with [[Batman]] villain [[Doctor Double X]] after meeting a motivational therapist named Professor Andrea Wye. Both of them are defeated by Batman and Flash.<ref>''The Brave and the Bold'' #194</ref> He later becomes a minor enemy of the [[Justice League]], appearing briefly at a villains gathering.<ref>''JLA-80 Page Giant'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Rainbow Raider later taking part in the riot in the super-hero prison of Belle Reve Penitentiary (he is quickly defeated by a single punch from [[Zauriel]]). During his time at Belle Reve, he was part of the Color Queens prison gang alongside [[Crazy Quilt]], [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], [[Doctor Spectro]], and [[Multi-Man]].<ref>''JLA'' #34 (October 1999). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nRoy is slain by the villainess [[Blacksmith (character)|Blacksmith]] when she impaled him with his latest work of art.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #183 (April 2002). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Rainbow Raider is one of the many deceased characters temporarily reanimated as a zombie within the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (November 2009). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, \"[[The New 52]]\" rebooted the DC universe. Roy uses the alias of '''Chroma''', rather than Rainbow Raider. During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Chroma was present in Central City when [[Gorilla Grodd]] invaded the city with his army of gorillas. He, Girder, and Tar Pit saw [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] defeated by Gorilla Grodd. After Gorilla Grodd punches Girder enough to crumble, Chroma runs away with Tar Pit. Gorilla Grodd later kills Chroma to serve as a warning to the other villains that the Gem Cities are his. Upon [[Solovar]] being chained up, the heads of Chroma and the Mayor of Central City are placed around him.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #23.1: Grodd''. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nChroma later appears somehow alive and intact. He and Tar Pit are robbing jewelry stores until they are stopped by Flash.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #27. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Rainbow Raiders===\nSince Rainbow Raider's death, a team of color-themed supervillains have dubbed themselves the '''Rainbow Raiders''' in his honor.\n\nAfter the death of the first [[Captain Boomerang]], a funeral was held that every villain ever to face Flash attended. Among the large crowd was an eclectic group of metahumans calling themselves the \"Rainbow Raiders\", in honor of the late Flash villain. Their sentiments, expressed during the service, seemed to denote that the group was relatively new to the scene, and had little exposure, standing, or experience working together.\n\nThe Raiders were active during the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s second invasion of Earth, encountering [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Power Ring (DC supervillains)|Power Ring]] (who were disguised as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]]) while attacking the [[Missoula County, Montana]] [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] facility. The battle goes badly for the two, but thanks to the help of nearby civilians, believing that their beloved heroes are in trouble, attack the Raiders and allow Power Ring and Johnny Quick to rally and subdue the group.<ref>''JLA'' #110. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe fate of the Rainbow Raiders was intended for the pages of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', and was soon after released as a \"deleted page\" segment in ''Untold Tales of the Blackest Night''. Believing that, with the dead attacking, it was best to be on the 'winning side', the Raiders committed mass suicide in order to join the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. However they remained dead, because they lacked any emotional ties sufficient to draw the attention of the black power rings, which focused on resurrecting people who would inspire certain emotions in Earth's heroes and villains, such as [[Lex Luthor]]'s various murder victims, or fallen villains and heroes like [[Maxwell Lord]] and [[Elongated Man]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRainbow Raider's powers are derived entirely from the special goggles he wears, which allow him to project solid beams of rainbow-colored light he can either use offensively or as a slide for travel. In addition, he can coat people in certain colors of light to induce emotions (coating someone in blue light, for instance, would make them sad).\n\nEach member of the Rainbow Raiders have powers based on their color:\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Red: has super strength.\n* Orange: has fire powers.\n* Yellow: has super speed and electrical powers.\n* Green: manipulates plants.\n* Blue: is made of water.\n* Indigo: has shadow powers.\n* Violet: controls air and wind.\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Heavy.com]] lists Rainbow Raider as one of the worst supervillains of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jensen|first1=K.

Vic Munster later used the Rainbow Raider identity where he was defeated by Superboy.<ref>''Superboy'' #84 (October 1960). DC Comics.</ref>\n* Dr. Quin (a villain from the first ''[[Dial H for Hero]]'' series) appears in ''[[House of Mystery]]'' #167 (June 1967) as a different Rainbow Raider. This version temporarily gave himself powers using a rare crystal that changed his body into different colors (slowly following the sequence of the rainbow). Depending on which color he was at the time, he would gain a different superpower: Red gave him a super-hot beam, Orange gave him an obscuring cloud, Yellow gave him the ability to drain energy and super powers, Green enables him to slow the bodies of others to the point of paralysis for an hour, and Violet shrinks people and objects for an hour. His Blue and Indigo powers are never shown. He also had a secret final color power called Ultra-Violet which made him invisible.<ref>''The House of Mystery'' #167 (June 1967). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Several versions of Rainbow Raider appear in the live-action [[Arrowverse]] series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'':\n** Roy G.

Additionally, he is originally nicknamed '''Prism''' by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]], but [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] suggests \"Rainbow Raider\", which everyone refers to Bivolo as from then on despite Ramon calling it lame. In the episode \"[[Flash vs. Arrow]]\", Bivolo sends the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]] into a rage, but the [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Arrow]] keeps the speedster occupied long enough for Dr. [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Harrison Wells]] and [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]] to reverse Bivolo's effects. The Arrow and Flash later capture and imprison Bivolo off-screen. In the episode \"Rogue Air\", the Flash and his team work with [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart]] to transfer Bivolo and other metahuman prisoners to a new prison, but Snart helps the prisoners escape.

She is a former collections officer who was previously fired from three collection agencies for cancelling debts instead of collecting them and became a metahuman capable of inducing euphoric states in people. The Flash and Ramon confront her with a device they previously used to stop Bivolo, but she destroys it and sways them before escaping. After their ally [[Chester P. Runk (Arrowverse)|Chester P. Runk]] undoes the effects, the heroes learn of Bates' attempt to hijack a blimp to drop money out of to \"save people from the system\". With [[Allegra Garcia (Arrowverse)|Allegra Garcia]]'s help, the Flash convinces Bates to stand down and work on [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] Mayor Sampson's economic development committee to avoid being sent to [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]].\n* Roy G.
