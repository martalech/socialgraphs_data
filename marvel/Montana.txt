They take bets with a person calling himself \"The Bookie\", over whether Spider-Man will show up to battle \"Basher\", an unknown villain who claimed to have fought Spider-Man. Spider-Man shows up, but is revealed to be Screwball in disguise when the real web-head shows up. The Enforcers decide to get revenge on The Bookie, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance, and he agrees to help. Spider-Man defeats Fancy Dan and Montana.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #562.
