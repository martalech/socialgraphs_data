Army [[Corporal]] Joseph Ledger is given a strange crystal removed from Hyperion's spaceship by the government that bonds to him, causing him to fall into a [[coma]] for years.\n\nDiscovering Hyperion has superhuman abilities, the government uses him as a secret weapon, and is eventually outed by the [[News media|media]]. The government then announces and introduces Hyperion as a state-sponsored hero, which encourages other beings to appear, such as the [[The Atlanta Blur|Blur]], who can move at superspeed. Ledger awakens and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Doctor Spectrum]]. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum's crystal. The [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] is seen on dry land for the first time, and [[Power Princess|Princess Zarda]] heals Hyperion after his battle. [[Nighthawk (Supreme Power)|Nighthawk]] solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered [[serial killer]], who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his [[DNA]]. Although successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again. The government gathers the remaining superhumans into a team to capture Hyperion.\n\nThe story continues in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Supreme Power: Hyperion''<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1\u20135 (Nov. 2005\u2013March 2006)</ref> with new Squadron members [[Master Menace|Emil Burbank]], [[Arcanna]], the [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] and [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] tracking Hyperion to what they believe is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]. In this world, Hyperion and a version of the Squadron rule the world, with only Nighthawk and a small group of superhumans opposing their rule. Although the heroes locate the true Hyperion and convince him to return to their world, Burbank discovers that it was, in fact, not an alternate reality but their world two years from the present time.\n\n==== Second ''Squadron Supreme'' title ====\nThe second volume of the series ''Squadron Supreme''<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 2 #1\u20137 (May\u2013Nov. 2006)</ref> brings together all the superhumans (except a reluctant Nighthawk), who are split into two teams \u2014 one for international/public missions and another for covert operations. The [[President of the United States]] calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an [[Africa]]n [[dictator]] is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to [[Iran]] has member [[Inertia (comics)|Inertia]] encouraging a victim to fight back and kill. [[China]] recruits [[Redstone (comics)|Redstone]], the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion's DNA, in a bid to protect itself. The final issue is a battle to the death against Redstone (with the Blur recruiting Nighthawk to assist) who threatens to [[detonate]] a [[nuclear weapon]]. The outcome is not revealed, as the series concluded with issue #7.\n\n==== ''Ultimate Power'' ====\nAn unrelated nine-issue series, ''[[Ultimate Power]]'', written by J. Michael Straczynski; [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Jeph Loeb]] with art by [[Greg Land]],<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #1\u20133 (Dec. 2006\u2013Feb. 2007); 4\u20135 (June\u2013July 2007); 6\u20137 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 2007); 8 (Dec. 2007) and 9 (Feb. 2008)</ref> features the Squadron in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] into the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. Courtesy of a deception engineered by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the Ultimate villain [[Doctor Doom]], the Squadron travel to the Ultimate Universe, thinking that the Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States. A series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], the [[Ultimates]] and the [[Earth-712]] Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate Universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a [[Doombot]]) is captured.\n\n==== ''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'' ====\nAn unrelated four-issue limited series, ''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'', written by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and with art by [[Paul Gulacy]], relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]] in war-torn [[Sudan]]. Hyperion discovers Nighthawk has a [[prototype]] weapon built from stolen plans of Emil Burbank's journal that cannot actually injure him, but can convince him that he is being injured.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk'' #1\u20134 (March\u2013June 2007)</ref>\n\n==== Third ''Squadron Supreme'' title ====\nA third volume of the title ''Squadron Supreme'', written by [[Howard Chaykin]] and with art by [[Greg Land]] (and other artists), is published,<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 3 #1\u201312 (Sept. 2008\u2013July 2009)</ref> with the 12-issue series being set five years after the battle with Redstone. Most of the Squadron have disappeared, with Ultimate Nick Fury, Burbank and Arcanna now a team of intelligence officers working for the government and investigating a group of returning astronauts that exhibit strange abilities. The astronauts [[infect]] many people they come into contact with, also giving them superhuman abilities. Fury eventually leads a new version of the Squadron that features characters who are [[pastiche]]s of long-time Marvel characters. The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman [[terrorist]]s from the [[Middle East]], but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities. Fury later returns to the Ultimate Universe.\n\n==== Later appearances ====\nLater, the members of the Squadron Supreme are apparently killed by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] after the villains raid the Squadron's universe.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #24</ref> Versions resembling these characters later appear on the [[Battleworld]] created by Doctor Doom during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' event, only to be killed again at the hands of the [[Squadron Sinister]]. Nighthawk is left as the group's only survivor.<ref>''Squadron Sinister'' #1</ref>\n\n=== Earth-616 version ===\nThis team, set in Marvel's mainstream reality, features characters from numerous alternate universes, such as the Nighthawk from ''Supreme Power'', a Hyperion from a reality that had been destroyed upon colliding with another universe, Doctor Spectrum from the world of the Great Society (which was destroyed by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] to prevent it from colliding with the mainstream universe), the [[DP 7|Blur]] from the [[New Universe]], and [[Power Princess#Other versions|Warrior Woman]] from a [[Squadron Sinister#Secret Wars (2015)|''Secret Wars'' tie-in]] (posing as the Earth-712 Squadron Supreme's Power Princess).<ref>{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Brett |title=Marvel Announces \"Squadron Supreme\" From Robinson, Kirk |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-announces-squadron-supreme-from-robinson-kirk/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=March 16, 2019 |date=June 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 6) #0.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThrough Modred the Mystic's magical modifications to Reed Richard's time machine, Hyperion and Doctor Spectrum are accidentally transformed into ephemeral \"ghosts\" caught in the past; specifically during the Squadron's attack on Atlantis and just before Hyperion kills Namor. They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth. At the end of the story arc, Hyperion leads the action to disband the Squadron, and the team goes their separate ways.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 4 #13\u201315. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== Squadron Supreme of America ===\nWhen the Avengers become a global peacekeeping force, [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with [[Phil Coulson]] to discuss the matter.

After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio which has become a battleground.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Squadron Supreme are summoned to confront Black Panther when he infiltrates the Pentagon and confronts Phil Coulson. Hyperion states that the Squadron Supreme are the United States' sanctioned superhero team in light of the Avengers becoming an anti-American team. As Nighthawk states to Blur that the Black Panther will not run as he is under arrest, the Black Panther states to them that he does not know how they got their powers and that they are not the Squadron Supreme, as he even asked if they trust Phil Coulson. Before they can grab him, the Black Panther contacts [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] to teleport him away. As he disappears, the Black Panther states that Phil Coulson will not answer their questions and that the Avengers are not their enemies unless they force them to be.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #21.
