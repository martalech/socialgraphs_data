He first appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]]'s ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #40 (July 2003) written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] with art from [[Mark Bagley]]. Geldoff was brought into Earth-616 by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Christos Gage|Christos N. Gage]] in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #8 (February 2008), where he was given the code name '''Proton'''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{In-universe|date=October 2009}}\nGeldoff was a [[Latveria]]n orphan who was experimented on in the [[womb]]. While drunk at a party, Geldoff blew up random cars with his powers. Aware of Geldoff's rampages, [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] confronted the youth, denouncing his irresponsible behavior. When police arrived, Spider-Man made to leave, and Geldoff clung on to the back of his costume as Spider-Man swung away.\n\nSpider-Man again tried to make Geldoff realize how irresponsible he had been. Spider-Man tried to convince him to use his abilities to help people, but Geldoff could not see why. When Spider-Man paused to foil a robbery in a shop below, Geldoff blew up a vehicle outside the shop, injuring those inside indiscriminately. Geldoff believed he had performed a good deed, and was shocked when an enraged Spider-Man attacked him. Geldoff angrily threatened to use his powers directly on the hero, but was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. Confronted by the mutants, Geldoff fainted.\n\nGeldoff was taken back to their [[X-Mansion#Ultimate Marvel|mansion]] for examination. Awaking in a panic en route, Geldoff blew out the side of the plane. Later, at the mansion, [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor Xavier]] telepathically sedated Geldoff and determined his experimental origins. Horrified, Xavier decided to present Geldoff to scientific organizations and the [[United Nations]] as proof of immoral and illegal genetic research. Spider-Man headed home, but not before the woozy Geldoff apologized for threatening him.<ref>Ultimate Spider-Man #40-44. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nGeldoff can generate and discharge explosive energy balls. How this power effects living tissue is unknown, as he has yet to use it on anything organic. Geldoff himself seems immune to the energy.<ref>The Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe 2005: The Fantastic Four & Spider-Man</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Earth-616===\n[[Image:Proton.jpg|200px|thumb|Earth 616's Proton (Geldoff)<br>Art by [[Stefano Caselli]].]]\nGeldoff was introduced into [[Earth-616]] (core [[Marvel Universe]]) by writers [[Dan Slott]] and [[Christos Gage|Christos N. Gage]] along with artist [[Stefano Caselli]], as a [[Fifty State Initiative]] recruit in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #8 (February 2008) who arrives in the [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] training facility during the issue. Geldoff is seen in the following issue using the codename '''Proton''' during a combat training exercise when [[Michael Van Patrick#KIA|MVP clone KIA]] attacks. In the aftermath of the \"[[Avengers: The Initiative#Killed in Action|Killed In Action]]\" storyline, Proton is one of the recruits who presents a deceased Dragon Lord's ashes to his family.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMaking his first appearance outside ''Avengers The Initiative'', Proton is shown fighting a [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of [[New York City]] in ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #3. He is one of the characters who are shown to be killed during this issue, a scene later repeated in ''Avengers: the Initiative'' #16. ''Secret Invasion'' lead writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] commented on the death of Proton by saying that he had asked Dan Slott which character he could kill off, and stated that Slott had built characters for this exact purpose.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16695 \"SPOILERS OF WAR: Secret Invasion #3\" by Dave Richards.

He is introduced as a Latverian teenager visiting the U.S. as part of a student exchange programs, and begins to manifest his dormant [[The Inhumans|Inhuman]] heritage after being exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]. After a brief scuffle with the [[X-Men]], he is kidnapped by [[Monica Rappaccini]] of the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]] organization.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #15.INH.
