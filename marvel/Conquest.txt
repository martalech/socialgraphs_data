At age 17, Mark begins to display superpowers, which come from his father being a member of the Viltrumite race, who, according to Nolan, pioneer the galaxy on a mission of benevolence and enlightenment.\n\nAs [[Invincible (character)|Invincible]], Mark begins working as a superhero, with his father acting as his mentor, and meeting other heroes (including Robot, [[Rex Splode]], Dupli-Kate and [[Atom Eve]]), discovering that his physics teacher has been turning his students into human bombs, to foiling a plan by the Mauler Twins to make an army of robots. Meanwhile, Omni-Man is kidnapped by aliens, taken to another dimension. He returns after what seems to be only a few days but was actually eight months to him.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Ryan Ottley, Robert Kirkman and Cory Walker - Lucca Comics & Games 2018.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ryan Ottley]], [[Robert Kirkman]] and [[Cory Walker]] at [[Lucca Comics & Games]] 2018.]]\nWhile Robert Kirkman has been the sole writer of the series, Cory Walker and [[Ryan Ottley]] have contributed the art.

Cover art by [[Ryan Ottley]].]]\nIn 2003 and 2004, Image and Robert Kirkman published several other superhero series: ''[[Tech Jacket]]'' pencilled in a manga style by [[E. J. Su]] (cancelled at #6), the 3-issue ''Capes Inc.'' series drawn by Mark Englert and three oneshots starring [[Brit (comics)|Brit]], the first two with artwork from Tony Moore and the third with artwork by Cliff Rathburn.\n\nIn 2007, ''Brit'' was launched as an ongoing full-color series written by Bruce Brown, with artwork by Cliff Rathburn. The series was overseen and edited by Robert Kirkman. In late 2007, a two issue mini-series starring Atom Eve was released.\n\n''Tech Jacket'' was first collected as a [[digest-sized]], black and white [[graphic novel]] and later reissued in regular sized, full color and a cover scheme similar to Kirkman's other trade paper backs. ''Capes'' was collected as a trade paperback in summer 2007, and the three Brit one-shots were colored by Val Staples and published as a collection in 2007, as well.\n\nAt first shown to barely coexist in the same universe, the characters have since been integrated into Invincible's book. ''[[Tech Jacket]]'' was an ongoing series that tied into ''Invincible'' #27, and the character has been seen in the background of various battles during the series. The characters from ''Capes'' have also been supporting characters seen mainly in large superhero battles Invincible participates in, and the series ran as a back-up in the ''Invincible'' book starting with #27. Brit has had an even less substantial role, appearing a couple of times in the aforementioned brawls (understandable considering that after the last book ''Brit'' was somewhat-retired). Brit later went on to become the leader of the [[Guardians of the Globe]] and was featured heavily in comic spin-offs ''Guarding the Globe'' and ''Invincible Universe''. In ''[[The Astounding Wolf-Man]]'', Art, Invincible's tailor, appeared, designing the title character's costume. Wolf-man has also appeared in ''Invincible'' #48 & 49.\n\n==Collected editions==\n===Trade paperbacks===\nWith the exception of volumes 14, 18, 22, 24, and 25, every volume of the ''Invincible'' [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] is named after a television [[sitcom]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
