The character, based on the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]] from [[Norse mythology]], first appears in ''[[Marvel Tales (1949\u20131957)|Marvel Tales]]'' #105 (Feb. 1952), in the period between the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Midgard Serpent debuted in ''[[Marvel Tales (1949\u20131957)|Marvel Tales]]'' #105 (Feb. 1952) and was later tied firmly to Marvel continuity in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #127 (April 1966). As in Norse mythology, the Marvel version of the Midgard Serpent is the [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of the Thunder God, who has two encounters with the creature \u2013 the events based directly on mythology \u2013 in ''Thor'' #272-273 (June-July 1978).\n\nAn attempt to cheat the fatal prophecy made regarding a final battle between Thor and the Serpent occurred in ''Thor'' #274-278 (July-Dec. 1978), although the creature returned in ''Thor'' #325 (Nov. 1982-Jan. 1983). A \"larger than life\" battle between Thor and the Serpent was depicted in ''Thor'' #379-380 (May-June 1987), with writer-artist [[Walter Simonson]] using a [[Comics vocabulary|splash page]] to depict the creature's size, and then full pages to demonstrate the battle between the pair.\n\nAlthough killed, the Serpent was [[resurrect]]ed in ''Thor'' #486-488 (May-July 1995), and featured in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 3 #1 (Feb. 1998) before reappearing in ''Thor'' vol. 2 #80 (Aug. 2004).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Midgard Serpent first appears when a scientist draws what he believes to be venom from a statue of the creature, the liquid becoming a deadly [[solvent]].<ref>''Marvel Tales'' #105 (Feb. 1952)</ref>\n\nIn the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], the seer [[Volla (comics)|Volla]] makes a [[prophecy]] that the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] will battle the Midgard Serpent during [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] after it surfaces from the ocean and does terrible damage. Although the god will successfully kill the creature, he will only walk nine steps before dying from wounds carrying its deadly venom.<ref>''Thor'' #127 (April 1955), 200 (June 1972) and 294 (April 1980)</ref>\n\nThor has two encounters with the creature that reflect the Norse myths. The first is a visit to the castle of the Storm Giant [[Utgard-Loki (Marvel Comics)|Utgard-Loki]], who excels in the use of [[illusion]]s. Challenging Thor to lift his pet \"cat\", who in reality is the Midgard Serpent, the Storm Giant is terrified when the Thunder God lifts all but one of the cat's feet off the ground.<ref>''Thor'' #272 (June 1978)</ref> The second encounter occurs when Thor decides to cheat fate and kill the creature. Taking a fishing boat with the Giant Hymir, Thor uses the head of an [[ox]] on a chain to draw the Midgard Serpent to the surface of the ocean. Although the creature takes the bait, Thor is unable to deliver the killing blow as Hymir, fearing for his life, cuts the chain.<ref>''Thor'' #273 (July 1978)</ref>\n\nBeing aware of the prophecy regarding his son's death, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] (the king of the Norse gods) cheats fate during a false Ragnarok by replacing Thor with a surrogate known as '''Red Norvell''', who, after gaining the power of Thor and his hammer, dies battling the Midgard Serpent after it dives into the ocean. The prophecy fulfilled, Thor drives off the creature.<ref>''Thor'' #274-278 (July-Dec. 1978)</ref> The Midgard Serpent reappears briefly when a group of Odin's enemies feed the ''Golden Apples of Idunn'', intended for the Norse Gods, to the creature, intending to weaken the gods before an attack. It is used as a bridge by Tyr and Loki's army. Thor imprisons the creature and forces it to return the apples.<ref>''Thor'' #325 (Nov. 1982-Jan. 1983)</ref>\n\nThe character appears on Earth disguised as the monster [[Fin Fang Foom]] after some Giants summon him using one of them as bait on a giant fishing rod, and after the deception is revealed battles Thor to the death. He attacks Thor in a park still disguised as Fin Fang Foom, but does not recognize Thor who is wearing his Asgardian armor. After apologizing and talking to Thor, Fin Fang Foom says if Thor can lift his big toe, he will battle the \"super hero\" (Thor) away from the city. Thor is able to lift his big toe and rides him away from the city. When he realizes he does not know his foe's name, Thor tells him. The presence of the Midgard Serpent on Earth causes time to stop for everything except the two opponents and other mythic creatures. Although Thor finally kills the creature, his body is pulped, suffering from the ''Curse of [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]'': his bones become as brittle as glass, but he is unable to heal or die<ref>''Thor'' #379-380 (May-June 1987)</ref>(Thor \"resurrects\" himself by taking mental control of the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and forcing Hela to recreate his body and free him from her curse).<ref>''Thor'' #381 (Jul. 1987)</ref>\n\nThe Midgard Serpent is released from Hel (the Norse land of the dead) by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] warrior [[Kurse]] to use against Thor, who is swallowed by the creature. Together with ally [[Beta Ray Bill]], Thor blasts free of the creature's stomach and kills it a second time.<ref>''Thor'' #486-488 (May-July 1995)</ref>\n\nThe Midgard Serpent is apparently [[resurrect]]ed by [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], who summons the creature to Earth to distract the superhero team the Avengers while she abducts the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #1 (Feb. 1998)</ref> The Midgard Serpent briefly reappears when the true [[Ragnarok]] occurs.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #80 (Aug. 2004)</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, King Loki (a more evil version of Loki from an alternate future) frees the Midgard Serpent from Hel and rides on its back as part of a plot to attack Asgard.<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #14</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Midgard Serpent normally exists in [[Non-physical entity|ethereal]] form around Earth. A huge serpent, the character has immense strength and stamina, can generate both lethal fire and [[venom]], and project powerful illusions. He can cause earthquakes by flexing his coils around Earth.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Near the end of ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"A Day Unlike Any Other\", [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] banished [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to a world where he is tortured by the Midgard Serpent.\n* The Midgard Serpent appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"The Serpent of Doom\".

The Midgard Serpent was so powerful that it would grow until it could consume Earth. After a battle with the Avengers, the Midgard Serpent and Doctor Doom are banished to the Realm Below by the Avengers, who used Ulik's extra-dimensional magic portal. In \"The Doomstroyer\", the Midgard Serpent serves as Doctor Doom's line of defense at the time when he is controlling the Destroyer. Thor then fights the Midgard Serpent. After Doctor Doom deactivates the Destroyer, the Midgard Serpent is defeated by Thor and Loki.

It causes a rampage on the city until the Impossible Man \"scrubs the scene\" by making the villains disappear.\n\n===Film=== \n* As revealed in the original concept art for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Thor, Groot and Rocket Raccoon are shown fighting a big snake, which is confirmed to be the Midgard Serpent. a.k.a. the World Serpent.\n\n===Video games===\n* In the [[mobile game]] ''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'', the Midgard Serpent appears as an enemy, though this version is actually a doppelganger generated by the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] Malekith. After Malekith's defeat, Thor encounters the false Midgard Serpent face-to-face and dispatches it with a lightning blast.\n* The Midgard Serpent is also featured in the ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' virtual pinball game for [[Pinball FX 2]] released by [[Zen Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/marvel-pinball-vengeance-and-virtue-pack-gets-thor-217249.phtml |title=Marvel Pinball: Vengeance and Virtue pack gets Thor |publisher=www.destructoid.com |access-date=2014-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/midgardserpent.htm|Midgard Serpent}}\n\n{{Thor}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1952]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Norse mythology in Marvel Comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional snakes]]\n[[Category:Thor (Marvel Comics)]]"}}}]}}}}
