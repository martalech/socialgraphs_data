It was Image founding partner Jim Lee's first work published by the newly launched company, and his first creator-owned project. The Wildcats were the starting point for Lee's menagerie of interconnected superhero creations which became the foundation of the Wildstorm Universe. The Wildcats launched at the apex of a speculator-fueled comics sales boom and was wildly popular at its inception, with wholesale sales to comic book stores above one million copies for early issues. This first series ran for 50 issues, and in addition to Lee, featured work by comics creators such as [[Travis Charest]], [[Chris Claremont]], [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]] and [[Alan Moore]]. This popularity saw the property expand into other media, with an animated adaptation of the comic debuting on [[CBS]] in 1994 and a toyline from [[Playmates Toys]].\n\nIn 1998, ownership of the Wildcats concepts and characters were sold to [[DC Comics]], a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]], as part of DC's acquisition of Lee's company [[WildStorm|Wildstorm Productions]]. A new incarnation of the team was soon launched under the simplified title ''Wildcats'', focusing on the former members of the now-disbanded team and emphasizing a grittier tone during its 28-issue run. The third series, ''Wildcats Version 3.0'', revolved around the HALO Corporation, its [[CEO]] Jack Marlowe (an amalgamation of original team members [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan]] and Void), [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], and a gallery of new characters subverting corporate politics to their cause of creating a better world. This incarnation lasted 24 issues and was followed by a nine-issue limited series titled ''Wildcats: Nemesis'', which returned to a more superheroic style reminiscent of the first series. In late 2006, a fourth ongoing series was launched as a part of the Worldstorm publishing initiative. The series saw the return of Jim Lee as regular penciller for the first time since its first volume while [[Grant Morrison]] took over writing duties. Only one issue was ever published, with future issues placed on hold. In mid-2008, the fifth volume of Wildcats was launched, tying into the [[World's End (comics)|World's End]] crossover event.\n\n===''WildC.A.T.s'' volume 1===\nLaunched as an original Image comic book title by popular [[X-Men]] penciler Jim Lee and his friend writer Brandon Choi, the comic book's premise revolved around the centuries-long war between aliens called [[Kherubim]] and Daemonites. Kherubim, a nearly immortal, human-looking alien race with exceptional powers and skills, traveled to Earth and, by breeding with humans, populated the planet with \"Half-Breeds\". Daemonites, besides having a fearsome appearance, also possessed various superhuman abilities, including body possession and mental control over human beings. The initial arc brought [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] over to the team as the readers' point-of-view character as [[Helspont]], a Daemonite warlord, had taken control over [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Dan Quayle]]. [[Rob Liefeld]]'s [[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]] co-starred in the closing chapters of the arc.\n\n''WildC.A.T.s''{{'}} story continued in a three-part mini-series, penciled by Jae Lee, that introduced the Daemonite Lord Hightower. Jim Lee and [[Marc Silvestri]] proceeded to publish a 'Killer Instinct' crossover detailing Warblade's connection to Marc Silvestri's [[Cyber Force (comics)|Cyber Force]].\n\nJim Lee devoted his time to coming up with the new concepts of ''[[Gen13]]'', [[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]], and ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]''. Before he left the book, he did the four-issue ''Gathering of Eagles'' storyline written by his ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' writer, [[Chris Claremont]]. It featured a new villain in Tapestry and added the characters of [[Mister Majestic]], Savant, and Soldier, and featured Claremont's creator-owned character, Huntsman.\n\nAlmost all of the characters were spun off into their own mini-series, with Zealot featured in a series by [[Ron Marz]] and Terry Shoemaker,<ref>''Zealot'' #1 (August 1995)</ref> Spartan in one by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Mike McKone]],<ref name=\":20\">''Spartan: Warrior Spirit'' #1 (July 1995)</ref> Warblade sharing another with [[Cyberforce (Image Comics)|Cyberforce]]'s [[Ripclaw]], Grifter co-starred in The Kindred's limited series with Stormwatch's Backlash by [[Brett Booth]]<ref>''Kindred'' vol. 1 #1 (February 1994)</ref> that led to the latter's ongoing title, as well as another with Youngblood's [[Badrock]], Billy Tucci's [[Shi (comics)|Shi]], and even [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse's]] [[The Mask (comics)|the Mask]].\n\n[[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] wrote a handful of issues as well as a Team One Stormwatch/WildC.A.T.s mini-series detailing the past of the Wildstorm universe and would go on to write the Wildcats' first annual. The title also participated in the WildC.A.T.s-oriented \"[[Wildstorm Rising]]\" crossover that saw the heroes try to gain control of the Daemonite battleship, which turned out to be the Kheran ship instead, with WildC.A.T.s eventually leaving for Khera. Following a Grifter one-shot, the crossover gave birth to a short-lived Steven Seagle-written Grifter series that centered on his super-spy/superhero adventures while linking to an obscure Team One character Regiment at one point.\n\n[[Alan Moore]] then took over writing duties, and proceeded to tell a tale split between Savant and Majestic's replacement team on Earth and the original team journeying to Khera. The Kherubim had won the Daemonite-Kherubim war and were living in prosperity. Appearances were deceiving, however, and it was apparent the planet was run by power-hungry politicians who had ruthlessly subjugated the Daemonites as second-class citizens. Voodoo, with her Daemonite blood, experienced this firsthand. Maul's race was also treated unjustly and though Emp and Zealot were seduced by promises of power and recognition, Spartan discovered the truth about Khera's corrupt leaders. It took the death of one of Maul's race for the WildC.A.T.s to leave and head back for Earth. Voodoo and Emp both left the team, while the remainder joined with Savant and Majestic's new team. Moore also participated in [[Fire From Heaven (comics)|Fire From Heaven]], a fairly continuity-heavy crossover that resolved plotlines regarding [[Team One]], [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]], and Kaizen Gamorra.\n\nAlan Moore, Mike Lopez and Al Rio spun Voodoo off in a four-issue mini-series that dealt with voodoo magic,<ref name=\":19\" /> while Moore also wrote a time-traveling WildC.A.T.s/[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]] crossover mini-series drawn by [[Scott Clark (comics)|Scott Clark]] and inked by Sal Regla.\n\nAt the time, Grifter had another turn at an ongoing series, this time written by Steven Grant and drawn by Mel Rubi and [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]], while Zealot was featured in a [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Backlash]] spinoff, ''[[Wildcore]]''.\n\nBarbara Randall Kesel, [[Pasqual Ferry]], Rich Johnson and Carlos D'Anda crafted a two-part storyline that, in effect, wrote Majestic, Savant and Ladytron out of the team,<ref>''WildC.A.T.s'' #35 (March 1997)</ref><ref>''WildC.A.T.s'' #36 (March 1997)</ref> and set up the spin-off ''Savant Garde'', written by Randall Kesel. Original scripter Brandon Choi returned alongside Johnathan Peterson and artists Mat Broome and [[Ed Benes]] for a storyline with an organization called Puritans as the main villains. The Puritans' goal was to eradicate the Kherubim and Daemonites on Earth by traveling back in time and erasing killing them before the aliens could influence global events.<ref name=\":18\" /> A new line-up of WildC.A.T.s traveled in time to stop the Puritans, and had various adventures throughout different time periods.\n\n===''Wildcats'' volume 2===\nAfter the first series' cancellation, WildStorm, now an imprint of [[DC Comics]], resurrected the Wildcats under a whole different premise\u2014Wildcats dealt with the lives of the original members after the team's breakup following a botched mission during which team member Zealot apparently died. Scott Lobdell provided the writing for the initial seven issues as well as a Mosaic one-shot detailing the change in Lord Emp, with Travis Charest penciling most of them. New villains like Kenyan and CC Rendozzo were featured as antagonists, but it was all dropped very quickly, with Charest leaving the monthly comic format to work on a French [[Metabarons]] graphic novel called ''Dreamshifters'' and Lobdell exiting a couple of issues later.\n\nAs [[Joe Casey]] and [[Sean Phillips]] took over Wildcats, they quickly dealt away with Kenyan, while Void and Emp ended up having Spartan absorb their assets and powers; thus the book began a long spell featuring him aided by Ladytron and Grifter with Maul and Voodoo guest-starring, as well as new characters Noir, Agents Wax, and Mohr of the National Park Service. Warblade was featured very briefly, last seen in the Wildcats 2000 annual that brought back the dead version Condition Red killing Olympia. Casey and Phillips signaled the new Wildstorm, critically acclaimed but low on readers' radar. The heroes fought Samuel Smith (a superhuman [[serial killer]] whose grandfather had appeared in Team One: WildC.A.T.s) after which eventually Zealot returned. Casey also wrote the Ladytron one shot, a farsic rendition of her past, as well as a Mister Majestic ongoing series which ran for nine issues.\n\n''Wild Times: Wildcats'' and ''Wild Times: Grifter'' were published as one-shots as a part of the crossover series ''Wild Times'' that spotlighted the characters in [[Elseworlds]]-like alternate reality scenarios that blended genres. Wildcats also participated in the [[WildC.A.T.s/Aliens]] crossover written by Stormwatch's Warren Ellis that served as a coda to that series and a prequel to his [[The Authority (comics)|Authority]] run, having very little to do with the Wildcats themselves.\n\n===''Wildcats'' 3.0===\nThe third series, ''Wildcats Version 3.0'', was a part of the mature readers' Eye of the Storm imprint, dealing with Spartan's (now Jack Marlowe) agenda to better the world by proliferating advanced technology and power sources throughout the world via the HALO Corporation. Grifter was his troubleshooter and Agent Wax was one of his first associates. The stories added a motley group to this proactive organization including the power broker C.C. Rendozzo and her organization, Agent Orange, and Grifter's unlikely pupil Edwin Dolby, one of HALO's accountants. The series ended with a thunderous finale where Zealot, Marlowe, and a team assembled by Grifter destroyed the Coda chapter that Zealot had created on Earth. The series was written by [[Joe Casey]] and drawn by [[Dustin Nguyen (comics)|Dustin Nguyen]], [[Duncan Rouleau]], Francisco Ruiz Velasco, Pascual Ferry and Sean Phillips.\n\nConcurrent with ''Wildcats Version 3.0'', Wildstorm also published a critically acclaimed noir-superhero series ''[[Sleeper (comic book)|Sleeper]]'' starring Alan Moore's Wildcats villain Tao, which also featured Grifter. As part of the crossover Coup D'\u00c9tat, centering on the Wildstorm Universe's United States, a Wildcats 3.0: Coup D'\u00c9tat one-shot was released.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DC/WildStorm Stages Coup D'\u00c9tat|url=https://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/5?articleID=8055|access-date=June 2, 2020|website=Diamond}}</ref>\n\nAfter guest-starring in Superman books, in 2004 DC published a ''[[Mister Majestic|Mr. Majestic]]'' mini-series to test waters for an ongoing series that ran for 17 issues.\n\nWildcats starred in a limited series by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Talent Caldwell]] entitled ''Wildcats: Nemesis'', focusing on Zealot, Majestic, and the Coda continuity, while heavily spotlighting the new Wildstorm universe anti-hero character of Nemesis.\n\nAt the same time, Wildstorm published the ''[[Captain Atom#\"Armageddon\" and WorldStorm|Captain Atom: Armageddon]]'' maxi-series, heavily featuring the Wildcats as they tried to help DC character Captain Atom return to his universe and stop him from accidentally destroying their reality. Nikola, a female medic, became the new Void with Captain Atom sharing a part of the power that eventually remade the Wildstorm universe altogether.\n\n===''Wildcats'' volume 4===\nIn 2006, as part of the \"Worldstorm\" line-wide event, the title was restarted, written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Jim Lee]]. The team consisted of Spartan, [[Mister Majestic|Mr. Majestic]], Zealot, Grifter, Voodoo, Savant, and Ladytron. Warblade is on a secret mission, and Maul has retired to his civilian identity. Kaizen Gamorra returned as the villain, aided by the WildCats' first enemy, Helspont. However, the title was permanently put on hold after only one issue.\n\n===''Wildcats'' volume 5===\nIn July 2008 Wildstorm debuted a new ongoing WildCats series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=9772 |title=Comics |publisher=DC Comics |access-date=2015-10-01}}</ref> written by [[Christos Gage]]<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=154824 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818200633/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=154824 |date=August 18, 2009 }}</ref> and pencilled by [[Neil Googe]]<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156755 ] {{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> following on from the imprint's ''[[Number of the Beast (comics)|Number of the Beast]]'' mini-series.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=154293 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207030710/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=154293 |date=December 7, 2008 }}</ref> [[Adam Beechen]] took over writing duties from Gage in late 2009,<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Adler |url=http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/p/detail/wildstorm-berries-adam-beechen-talks-wildcats |title=WildStorm-Berries: Adam Beechen Talks WildCats |publisher=Broken Frontier |date=October 27, 2009 |access-date=October 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031053647/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/p/detail/wildstorm-berries-adam-beechen-talks-wildcats |archive-date=October 31, 2009 }}</ref> with he and artist [[Tim Seeley]] starting with issue #19<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Arrant |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091125-Wildcats-Beechen-Seeley.html |title=New WILDCATS Team Keeps Fighting at World's End |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=November 25, 2009 |access-date=November 29, 2009 }}</ref> until the book's cancellation in December 2010 with #30.\n\n===''Wildcats'' volume 6===\n\n==Cast==\n===Original team===\nThe original WildC.A.T.s (Covert Action Team) consisted of:\n* Spartan ('''Jack Marlowe''', originally '''Hadrian-7'''): Originally intended to be a highly sophisticated cyborg who could \"die\" and easily be downloaded to another body,<ref>''WildC.A.T.s'' #4 (March 1993)</ref> Spartan's character has been revised several times.

Zealot is the former Majestrix of the Coda and helped develop their virtues and practices. She has lived for thousands of years and has had many relationships with both humans and aliens alike. In Khera, Zealot was ordered to breed with [[Mr. Majestic|Majestros]], which she did, resulting in the birth of Savant. However, since bearing a child would change Zealot's social standing and ensure she could never be a warrior ever again, Zealot's mother Harmony convinced her to lie to everyone that the child was stillborn, while Harmony pretended that the child was, in fact, hers.<ref name=\":4\">''Wildstorm Winter Special'' #1 (January 2005)</ref> The child was named Kenesha and raised as Zealot's sister, though Kenesha would become best known by the name '''Savant'''.<ref name=\":4\" /> Zealot left the Coda, believing they did not follow the order's true precepts, and she would go on to fight against the Coda on multiple occasions.

Throughout most of Emp's time in the Wildcats, he possessed little control over his powers, mostly serving as the team leader and advisor, usually not going out into the field.

Despite some confusing flashbacks at the start, he is at least capable of stringing a story together. As long as you concentrate (a lot of characters and factions are introduced very quickly), it's an enjoyable if fairly linear tale. And of course, the art is simply stunning.\"<ref name=\"Arcane2\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===TV series===\n{{Main|Wild C.A.T.s}}\nA WildC.A.T.s TV series was created in 1994. It had only thirteen episodes and a more family-friendly storyline.

The group was composed of all the original 'C.A.T.s. The major villain was Helspont, but the Troika and the Coda were featured.
