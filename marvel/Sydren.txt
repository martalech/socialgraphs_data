('''Sentient World Observation and Response Department''') is a [[fiction]]al [[counterterrorism]] and [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] agency appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Its purpose is to deal with [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] threats to world security and is the space-based counterpart of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which deals with local threats to the world.\n\nThe organization appears in several forms of media, such as ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) miniseries ''[[WandaVision]]'' on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Publication history==\nS.W.O.R.D. was first introduced in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #6 and was created by [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=366}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional organization biography==\nIn the comics, S.W.O.R.D. was originally an offshoot of S.H.I.E.L.D., but since the departure of [[Nick Fury]] as director of S.H.I.E.L.D., relations between the two organizations have become strained. The head of S.W.O.R.D. is Special Agent [[Abigail Brand]]. Its primary command-and-control headquarters are aboard the orbital [[space station]] known as the Peak.\n\nS.W.O.R.D. had an undercover operative in the [[X-Mansion]]. In ''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3, #17, the identity of this undercover operative was revealed to be [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]].\n\n===In \"Unstoppable\"===\nThe [[Astonishing X-Men]], as well as [[Armor (comics)|Hisako Ichiki]], [[Ord (comics)|Ord of the Breakworld]], and [[Danger Room|Danger]], are taken to deep space by S.W.O.R.D. and Agent [[Abigail Brand]]. S.W.O.R.D. psychics fail to detect Cassandra Nova in [[Emma Frost]]'s shattered psyche. Though emotionally wounded, Emma recovered fast enough to be present for the team's departure to the Breakworld, where they planned to disable a missile aimed at Earth. Before they reached Breakworld, they were attacked by enemy vessels. After creating a diversion, the X-Men and Agent Brand landed on the planet, where Agent Deems was being tortured in prison.\n\nBrand, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], Emma Frost, and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] landed together, while [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Hisako, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], and [[Kitty Pryde]] landed elsewhere. Wolverine's spacecraft disintegrated in mid-air and they were forced to abandon ship. Kitty and Colossus phased through the pod to the planet's surface, where they landed unharmed. Hisako and Wolverine landed with the impact burning Wolverine's skin.\n\nAnother team composed of Lockheed, Sydren, and S.W.O.R.D. troops converged upon a place called \"the Palace of the Corpse\".\n\nNear the end Agent Brand informs Kitty that Lockheed is working for S.W.O.R.D. as their undercover agent. \n\n===In \"Secret Invasion\"===\nDuring the 2008 \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline, S.W.O.R.D.'s headquarters called the Peak is destroyed by a [[Skrull]] infiltrator posing as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Dum Dum Dugan]]. Many agents die in the initial explosion, though others survive due to hostile-environment suits. Brand, encased in one of the suits, manages to make her way into one of the Skrull ships.{{issue|date=September 2017}}\n\n===In \"Dark Reign\"===\nDuring the 2008 - 2009 \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, S.H.I.E.L.D. is reformed as [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] under [[Norman Osborn]]. S.W.O.R.D.'s position under H.A.M.M.E.R. has not yet been revealed. In the ''[[Beta Ray Bill]]: Godhunter'' mini-series, Beta Ray Bill visits Agent Brand aboard the rebuilt Peak in order to obtain information about the whereabouts of [[Galactus]].\n\n==''S.W.O.R.D.'' volume 1==\nDuring the 2009 Chicago Comic Con, it was announced that [[Kieron Gillen]] will collaborate with Steven Sanders on a ''S.W.O.R.D.''
