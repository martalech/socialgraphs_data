Both series involved teams of primarily dark skin tone superheroes banding together in [[New York City]] to fight injustice. \n\nThe first series was published in [[2003 in comics|2003]] and ran for seven issues. The series was written by [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Christopher Priest]] and illustrated by [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]]. The second series, a revival known as ''Black Panther and the Crew'', was published in 2017 and ran six issues. It was written by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] and illustrated by [[Butch Guice]].\n\n==Publication history==\n=== 2003 series ===\nAccording to writer [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s pitch, ''The Crew'' was about four hardened heroes who had all lost their families; four men who came together initially out of self-interest, but would soon discover their commonality of loss. The Crew was all in one way or another orphans. These men were intensely dedicated to their respective goals, but each had a hole in their center. The seven stories that were released before the book's cancellation were for the most part introductory pieces, basically breaking down the lives of each member, his personal pain, and the universe he lived in. If the series had continued, it would have highlighted each man's personal evolution to his \"state of grace.\"<ref name=\"See [http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm Digital Priest: The Crew]\"/>\n\nThe bulk of the first [[story arc]], ''Big Trouble In Little Mogadishu'', was focused on the origin of Josiah X, son of [[Isaiah Bradley]] from ''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]''. Writer Priest intended that Josiah would eventually lead the team.<ref name=\"See [http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm Digital Priest: The Crew]\"/><ref name=\"See [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Crew Marvel Universe: The Crew]\">See [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Crew Marvel Universe: The Crew]</ref>\n\n=== 2017 series ===\nAfter the success of his run on ''[[Black Panther (Marvel Comics)|Black Panther]]'', Coates launched the spinoff title ''Black Panther and the Crew'', a revival of the 2003 series.<ref name=expanding>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/4639911/ta-nehisi-coates-is-expanding-the-black-panther-universe-with-the-crew/ |title=Ta-Nehisi Coates Is Expanding the Black Panther Universe with ''The Crew'' |work=Time |first=Eliana |last=Dockterman |date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> \n\nCoates originally wanted to use the same characters from the 2003 series, but found that a number of them weren't available.<ref name=expanding /> After selecting a new Crew, he ultimately added two female members \u2014 [[Misty Knight]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. Poet [[Yona Harvey]] also contributed to the series (as she did on another short-lived ''Black Panther'' spinoff, ''[[World of Wakanda]]'').

Princeton Walk was developed by multimillion-dollar investments and tax incentives to Grace & Tumbalt, a largely black-owned corporation, who cleaned up a section of Brooklyn and moved the criminal element and the poverty line residents out.<ref name=\"See [http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm Digital Priest: The Crew]\">See [http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm Digital Priest: The Crew] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525134513/http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm |date=2011-05-25 }}</ref> Little Mogadishu, or \"The Mog,\" as the locals call it, is a side effect of the gentrification process so that displaced criminal and poverty elements are now concentrated in a war zone outside Princeton Walk's walls.<ref name=\"See [http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/start.htm Digital Priest: The Crew]\"/>\n\nJim Rhodes, formerly [[War Machine]] but now down on his luck, came to Little Mogadishu to look into the murder of his estranged sister, and when it became apparent that the police were not going to get any results, he took the matter into his own hands. He delivered the men responsible for his sister's murder to the police in a neatly tied up package for them, coming across the local Muslim preacher [[Josiah X]] along the way. However, this was not enough to satisfy Rhodey, and he set his sights on the 66 Bridges leader, Triage. His covert, vigilante action and contact with Josiah put him on [[Kasper Cole]]'s radar, making Kasper suspicious of what a guy like Rhodey was doing in a place like the Mog.  Rhodey hit Little Mogadishu like a force of nature, derailing the secret money train that delivered bribes in bulk to a large number of corrupt officials. This action drew in Junta, who smelled the opportunity to leverage his way back into the spy business if he could get a piece of the action. He found himself drafted into Rhodey's plan along with Kasper Cole and eventually a reluctant Josiah X.\n\nTogether, the Crew blackmailed a long list of corrupt officials to turn in evidence against 66 Bridges and Triage and then went after Triage directly. As Triage was no lightweight, the situation got messy and some of the Crew had to decide between their self-interests and being heroes. For Josiah, the decision to do the right was simple and instant. Junta reluctantly turned Triage into the authorities, blowing his chance to use Triage to get back in with his former bosses. Kasper Cole kept busy saving lives as the White Tiger, sacrificing his chance to get in on the big bust as Kasper Cole and further his police career.\n\nThe Crew apparently did not remain together after this event. Rhodey soon went back to being War Machine, and Josiah was said to have disappeared.{{cn|date=July 2020}}\n\nWhile many of the characters in ''The Crew'' were members of racial minorities in the United States, Priest chose not to center ''The Crew'' around race relations: \n{{quote|So I find myself having to say, more than what ''The Crew'' is, what ''The Crew'' is not. ''The Crew'' is not The Black [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. ''The Crew'' is not \"A Ghetto Book\". ''The Crew'' is not even remotely about race. Race is never even mentioned in ''The Crew''.
