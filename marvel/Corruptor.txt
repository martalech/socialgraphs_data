Corruptor later abandoned the Circle.<ref>''Nova'' #21</ref>\n\nHe formed a new plan that started out by corrupting the [[Hulk]], forcing the Hulk's best friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to summon the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] so that the Corruptor could corrupt them as well. Rick's SOS instead was intercepted by several superheroes based in the Southwest, including [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)]], [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]], [[Texas Twister]], and [[Shooting Star (comics)|Shooting Star]].

Using flowers grown from water distilled with his own sweat, he managed to release his chemical influence over the entire town, quickly setting himself up as its mayor. His scheme was uncovered by the New Warriors, who were roaming the country helping small towns fight big villains, and the Corruptor was defeated once more.<ref>''The New Warriors'' vol. 2 #6</ref> He was later involved in a [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] terror plot in [[London]], only to be foiled by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]].<ref>''Union Jack'' #1-3</ref>\n\nJackson has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #35</ref> He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Dr. Strange.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual #2</ref> In [[Secret Invasion]], he is one among many of supervillains who rejoined of The Hood's crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #50</ref>\n\n[[Living Laser]] and the Corruptor attack [[Bucky Barnes]] and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] as they spy on some [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents from a rooftop in [[Brooklyn]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' #61</ref> He was later seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''Siege'' #3</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Search for Tony Stark\" arc, Corruptor rejoined Hood's gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nThe Corruptor's sweat glands exude psychoactive drugs which enable him to, by touch, subvert the will of any individual. His touch releases his victim's inhibitions, so that, if not given specific instructions, the victim will revert to uncontrollable behavior. Early in his career, he demonstrated such powers as super-strength, eye-beams, and teleportation, none of which he possesses today.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/c/corruptor.htm Corruptor at MarvelDirectory.com]\n{{Nova}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Delaware]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]"}}}]}}}}
