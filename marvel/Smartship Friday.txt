In 2005, the title was relaunched as a series aimed at younger readers\u2014though this was eventually declared a separate continuity from that of the original series and the mainstream Marvel Universe.\n\nThe team consists of four siblings: Alex Power, Julie Power, Jack Power, and Katie Power. The dying alien called Whitey, a scientist of the Kymellian race, transfers one of his four superpowers to each of the Power children so they can save their planet from the alien conquerors known as the Snarks. The children band together as the superhero team Power Pack. Along with fighting aliens and super-villains, the team's stories were known for focusing on morality debates and social issues such as child abuse, homelessness, drug abuse, bullying, and the ethics of using excessive or lethal force in combat.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n===Original series===\nDuring the early 1980s, Marvel Comics had a policy that all their editors should also be writers. [[Louise Simonson]]  was encouraged to think of a series she could write, and eventually she pitched a team of pre-teen siblings with superpowers called Power Pack. Simonson later explained:\n{{blockquote|I had resisted [[Jim Shooter|Shooter]]'s encouragement to write stuff or do freelance stuff because I thought he had writers whose livelihoods depended on their doing books and it didn't feel fair to take the work away from them. I had a job. But then Shooter hired a whole batch of new editors, and my workload was cut in half. I got bored and I thought I should create something rather than take one of the jobs that were already there, so I proposed the idea for \"Power Pack\" to Shooter. He eventually loved the idea, and so that was my taste of writing. I found it more challenging than editing, and way more fun, because I had been editing for a long time so I think it had gotten too easy for me.<ref name=\"GenRoles\">(March 8, 2013). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44169 Women in Comics: Simonson, Nocenti Talk Marvel & Gender Roles in Comics], Comic Book Resources.</ref>}}\n\nSimonson chose [[June Brigman]] as ''Power Pack'''s penciler because of her talent for drawing children.<ref name=\"GenRoles\"/> The ''Power Pack'' series premiered in May 1984 (cover date August 1984) in a double-sized issue inked by [[Bob Wiacek]].<ref>Marvel Comics' original advertisement, indicating a May 1, 1984, release date</ref> The series continued into 1991, during which time Brigman and Wiacek were replaced by [[Jon Bogdanove]] and [[Hilary Barta]] as principal artists. The ''Power Pack'' letters column, titled \"Pick of the Pack\", printed drawings and jokes about the characters submitted by readers, an unusual practice for a Marvel title.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nIn the first story of the series, the alien Kymellian known as Whitey is fatally injured by the alien villains known as Snarks. He gives the four Power children his powers before dying. His mass control power goes to Jack, his energy and disintegration power goes to Katie, his ability to fly goes to Julie, and his control over gravity goes to Alex. In issue #25, the team's powers are temporarily stolen, then returned but rearranged. Due to this \"power switch\", each Power Pack child now has an ability wielded by one of their siblings, leading to a change in codenames.<ref>''Power Pack'' Vol. 1 #25 (Marvel Comics).</ref> The Power Pack children finally switched their costumes to match their new powers in issue #47. In issue #52, another rearrangement of powers and codenames occurred.\n\n[[File:Powerpackad.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement for the debut of the team's comic book (1984)]]\nUnlike superheroes such as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Batman]] who were orphaned, free agents, or teenagers often trusted to be on their own without supervision, Power Pack was made up of pre-adolescent siblings who had a close relationship with each other, as well as their supportive parents Jim and Maggie Power. Early in the series, the children decided to keep their powers and superhero activities concealed from their parents, believing it would cause them stress and worry. This decision led to several moral compromises and feelings of guilt for the Power Pack members whenever they had to lie to friends and family or allow harm to occur because helping could mean revealing their abilities.<ref name=\"PPVol1-28\">''Power Pack'' #38</ref> The question of whether or not the powers should be revealed was also an ongoing source of debate among the children. ''Power Pack'' readers also argued the matter out in the series letter pages. During Jon Bogdanove's story \"Revenge of the Bogeyman\", which served as a tie-in for the crossover [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]], the parents learn their children are superheroes.<ref>''Power Pack'' Vol. 1 #42\u201343 (Marvel Comics).</ref> In an epilogue to the story, writer Julianna Jones depicted Jim and Maggie Power as so overwhelmed by the situation that they increasingly suffer psychological breakdowns and become convinced that they are not fit parents for superheroes. To help the Power family, the New Mutants team convinces Jim and Maggie Power that they were deceived and their children were never superheroes. This restored the secret identity status quo and led Power Pack to keep their heroic lives a secret again.<ref>''Power Pack'' Vol. 1 #44 (Marvel Comics).</ref>\n\nDespite the characters of ''Power Pack'' being children, the series often dealt with mature issues.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Markstein|first1=Don|title=Power Pack|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/powerpak.htm|access-date=April 2, 2020|website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia}}</ref> Many of the social problems of the 1980s found their way into the book's storylines. Among the themes addressed were pollution,<ref>''Power Pack'' #48\u201349</ref> drug abuse,<ref>''Power Pack'' #7\u20138, #29\u201332</ref> runaways,<ref name=\"ppcad\">''Power Pack/Cloak and Dagger: Shelter from the Storm'' (1990)</ref> kidnapping,<ref>''Power Pack'' #12, #14, #20, #22\u201326, #39\u201340; ''Uncanny X-Men'' 195</ref> gun violence,<ref>''Power Pack'' #29, #30</ref> bullying,<ref name=\"PPVol1-28\" /> orphanhood,<ref>''Power Pack'' 18\u201320, 27</ref> and homelessness.<ref name=\"ppcad\" /> Stories regularly depicted the Power children learning and debating how to use their potentially lethal powers responsibly, often on their own but sometimes with guidance from older heroes such as [[Spider-Man]]. In one early issue, Jack was wracked with remorse when he thought he had killed a man.<ref>''Power Pack'' #8</ref> In a later story arc, Katie seriously injures a Snark prince named Jakal, which causes her immense guilt and leads her to call herself a \"monster\".<ref>''Power Pack'' #23\u201325</ref>\n\nAs the series went on, the children were shown to slowly age and mature. In issue #1, Alex is 12 years old, Julie is 10, Jack is 8, and Katie is 5.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} In issue #45, Julie graduates from elementary school with honors in English, and the story says she will join Alex at school 44 (an actual middle school existing in [[New York City]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nThe same year Power Pack debuted, the team appeared alongside [[Spider-Man]] in a special comic designed to discuss children targeted by sexual abuse. The one-shot issue, written by Louise Simonson, was distributed for free and reprinted in the comics sections of many major newspapers.<ref>''Power Pack and Spider-Man''</ref> Marvel continued the campaign by featuring the characters in print [[public service announcement]]s.<ref>''Power Pack'' #23</ref> Later the same year, the writers used the Snark Wars storyline (wherein the children are kidnapped by the evil Snark alien race) to address the issue of child abduction. During the same storyline, photos of missing children were printed in lieu of the comic's regular [[Comic book letter column|letters column]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #22\u201326</ref> In 1989, the Power Pack teamed-up with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] in a special graphic novel addressing teen homelessness and runaways. Hotline telephone numbers for [[Covenant House]] were printed on the back cover.<ref name=\"ppcad\" />\n\nAlong with Spider-Man and the duo of Cloak and Dagger, Power Pack frequently encountered members of the [[X-Men]] and [[New Mutants]]. In issue #16, they met Franklin Richards (son of [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] and [[Invisible Woman]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]), and in issue #17 Franklin became a part-time member of Power Pack himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} He joined on many other adventures, occasionally staying with the Power family for days at a time when his own family were off on adventures.\n\nStarting with issue #34, the ''Power Pack'' series regularly rotated writers. Simonson wrote issues #35, #37, and #39\u201340, while John Bogdanove wrote issue #36, issues #42\u201343, and issues #47\u201352. Howard Mackie wrote issue #34, Julianna Jones wrote issues #38 and #44\u201345, Steven Heyer wrote #41, Terry Austin wrote issues #46 and #53, Judy Bogdanove wrote #54, and [[Dwayne McDuffie]] wrote issue #55. During Jon Bogdanove's final issues, Franklin Richards returned as a regular member of the team.\n\nFurther changes involved Alex Power mutating into a Kymellian appearance without explanation, forcing him to hide from his girlfriend Allison (who soon dates someone else) as well as from public life.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The series was cancelled with issue #62. The final issue, printed in the fourth quarter of 1990 (cover-dated February 1991), depicted the team and their parents journeying into space together.\n\nOne year after the original series' cancellation, creators Louise Simonson and June Brigman teamed up for the one-shot issue ''Power Pack Holiday Special'' (published in fourth quarter of 1991, with a cover date of February 1992). The one-shot comic resolved the cliffhanger the series had ended on, restored the Power Pack members' original powers, and undid some of the changes to the characters done during the run by Michael Higgins and Tom Morgan. ''Power Pack Holiday Special'' also included a short comedy story involving an art style that evoked ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', and a short story that showed an older, teenage Julie dealing with romance and self-esteem issues.\n\nThe ''Power Pack'' stories were reprinted by [[Marvel UK]] beginning around 1986. It was Marvel UK's practice at the time to use a less well-known series as a secondary story in a comic devoted to more recognizable characters, and ''Power Pack'' became the back-up \"strip\" in a run of Marvel's licensed ''[[Star Wars]]'' weekly ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/comics/mvukrotjw082.jpg&text=Star%20Wars:%20Return%20of%20the%20Jedi%20Weekly%2082 |title=cover of UK Star Wars comic showing Power Pack as back up strip |publisher=Rebelscum.com |access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> During this period, it was printed partly in black and white and partly in color, as was the main ''Star Wars'' strip. ''Power Pack'' subsequently became the back-up strip for the UK ''[[ThunderCats (comics)|ThunderCats]]'' comic, where it remained until its eventual replacement by the ''[[Galaxy Rangers]]'' series.\n\n===2000 miniseries===\nA four-part ''Power Pack'' mini-series published in 2000 depicted the children as now being slightly older than when they had last been in the 1991 ''Power Pack Holiday Special''. Katie was now in the fifth grade (having skipped two grades due to her intelligence), Jack had joined Julie in middle school, and Alex was now a teenager in high school. James and Maggie, the children's parents, were now aware that their children were also the heroes of Power Pack and accepted it. The Power children now wore masks when in costume and their superhero activities were largely restricted to \"practice sessions\" in the forest around their new home in [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge Island]], {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Seattle]]. The series once again pitted the Pack against Queen Mauraud and the Snarks.\n\n===Return of Power Pack===\n[[Joe Quesada]] announced in a ''New Joe Fridays'' column at [[Newsarama]] that Power Pack would be returning to the Marvel Universe in late 2007, after the events of ''Civil War''.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays24.html NEWSARAMA.COM: NEW JOE FRIDAYS&nbsp;\u2013 WEEK 24, A WEEKLY Q&A WITH JOE QUESADA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210011306/http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays24.html |date=December 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays35.html NEWSARAMA.COM: NEW JOE FRIDAYS&nbsp;\u2013 WEEK 35, A WEEKLY Q&A WITH JOE QUESADA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072744/http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays35.html |date=February 18, 2007}}</ref> However, due to the various delays within their release shipping schedules for Marvel Comics, these plans were put on hold. A new Power Pack story was commissioned for the 2007 Marvel Holiday Special,<ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Piece of Cake; Merry Christmas; Secret Santa (Loners story); The Meaning of Christmas</ref> which would have been the first original material featuring the full cast in the standard Marvel Universe since the 2000 mini-series. It was briefly summarized as \"Power Pack relives holidays past\" in official Marvel solicits, but the story was scrapped from the publication at the last minute, when it was decided to prioritize the recently canceled title ''The Loners'', which featured Julie Power among its cast. A ''Loners'' story written by [[CB Cebulski]] ran in place of the Power Pack story, though the official solicitation information still listed the Power Pack story and description.\n\nThree of the Power siblings{{Snd}}Alex, Jack, and Katie{{Snd}}appear within ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #574 (2010) as guests celebrating Franklin Richards' birthday. They were all depicted as only slightly older than they had been in the 2000 mini-series, with Alex still a teenager.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #574</ref> During the story, Alex was invited to join Reed Richards' [[Future Foundation]].<ref name=\"Fantastic Four #579\">''Fantastic Four'' #579</ref> He then made frequent appearances in the ''Fantastic Four'' series.<ref>''FF'' #15</ref>\n\nIn 2020, a 5-issue limited series written by [[Ryan North]] and illustrated by Nico Leon began publication as part of Marvel's ''[[Outlawed (comics)|Outlawed]]'' event.<ref name=\"Outlawed\">{{cite web|last=Marston|first=George|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/inside-the-return-of-power-pack-and-tying-into-outlawed-with-writer-ryan-north/|title=Inside the return of Power Pack (and tying into Outlawed) with writer Ryan North|date=August 2020|accessdate=May 4, 2021|website=[[GamesRadar+]]|publisher=[[Future US]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional team history==\n===At the beginning===\nAlex (age 12),<ref>''Power Pack'' #6</ref> [[Julie Power|Julie]] (10),<ref>''Power Pack'' #45</ref> [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Jack]] (8),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Comment from editors in Power Pack #6 \"Pick of the Pack\" letters column: \"Jack is almost nine\"</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Comment from editors in Power Pack #9 \"Pick of the Pack\" letters column, regarding Alex's \"my brother is almost 8\" comment in issue #6: \"Alex did screw up!

He thought Jack was a whole year younger than he is!\"</ref> and [[Katie Power]] (5)<ref>''Power Pack'' #16</ref> were bright, normal American children living with their parents in a beachfront house in [[Virginia]]. Their father, Dr. James Power, was a brilliant physicist who discovered a process to generate energy from [[antimatter]] with the assistance of a converter, of which he made a prototype. The process was, however, known to several alien races to cause chain reactions and destroy planets, and Dr. Power's knowledge of the process was discovered by Aelfyre \"Whitey\" Whitemane, a member of the [[Kymellian]] race, who resemble humanoid horses. A similar accident destroyed the Kymellians' home planet.<ref name=PP1>''Power Pack'' #1</ref>\n\nWhitey tried to stop the experiment by warning the Powers but was mortally wounded by his enemies, the reptilian [[Zn'rx|Snark]]s, in the process. The Snarks kidnapped Dr. Power and his wife, [[Margaret Power|Margaret]], hoping to obtain the secret of antimatter. Whitey rescued the Power children and told them what was happening. Before dying, he passed his powers to them to complete his mission.<ref name=PP1/>\n\nThe children, with the help of Whitey's \"Smartship\", a [[sentience|sentient]] starship called Friday, managed to stop the antimatter test by stealing and destroying the converter and rescued their parents from the Snarks. They decided to continue being superheroes and to hide their powers from their parents.<ref>''Power Pack'' #2\u20135</ref> Alex took the codename ''Gee'', Julie became ''Lightspeed'', Jack became ''Mass Master'', and Katie became ''Energizer''.<ref name=PP1/> They wore costumes made for them by Friday, which were actually Kymellian spacesuits. The costumes, which were constructed of unstable molecules and stored 'Elsewhere', could materialize and disappear on voice command.\n\nAfter rescuing their parents, the entire family moves to New York City, where the team attempted to deal with normal \"kid problems\" such as bullies and loose teeth while battling some of the deadliest villains in the Marvel Universe. The Pack fought the villain [[Kurse]] on two occasions during ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.<ref>''Power Pack'' #18; ''Secret Wars II'' #6</ref> They were also heavily involved in the events of the ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]''<ref>''Power Pack'' #35; ''X-Factor'' #25</ref> and ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' storylines.<ref name=pp42-44>''Power Pack'' #42\u201344</ref> During the ''[[Mutant Massacre]]'', they descended into the sewers and fought [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #27</ref>\n\nThe Pack's two greatest enemies during the original series were the Snarks and Carmody/The Bogeyman. The Snarks generally attempted to kidnap the Power children and steal their powers.<ref>''Power Pack'' #3\u20134, 16\u201317, 22\u201325, 50\u201352</ref> Carmody, James Power's former employer, spotted the Power children when they stole the antimatter converter at the beginning of the series and became obsessed with revenge.<ref>''Power Pack'' #2</ref> At first, he tried to work with government agencies to prove the Powers were mutants.<ref name=\"pp5\">''Power Pack'' #5</ref> Later, he became a supervillain himself, assuming the identity of the Bogeyman.<ref>''Power Pack'' #14\u201315, 37\u201340</ref> After being thrown into [[Otherplace|Limbo]] by [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] of the [[New Mutants]], he returned in a demonic form and nearly killed the entire Power family before ultimately committing suicide.<ref name=pp42-44/>\n\nPower Pack joined forces with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #7\u20138, #19; ''Strange Tales'' #12\u201314</ref> the [[X-Men]]<ref>''Power Pack'' #12, 27, 35, 44; ''Uncanny X-Men'' #195, #205</ref> and the [[New Mutants]]<ref>''Power Pack'' #20, 33, 39\u201340, 44</ref> on numerous occasions.\n\nThe team took great pains to conceal their superhuman abilities from their family and \"normal\" friends. However, during ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'', when confronted by the demonic Carmody, the children were forced to reveal their powers to save their parents.<ref>''Power Pack'' #42</ref> The discovery led Jim and Maggie to have mental breakdowns. They were restored to normal through the combined efforts of [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]] and [[Gosamyr]], who convinced them that the superpowered children were clones created to protect them from Carmody and that the \"real\" Power children, who were powerless, had been taken away and guarded by the New Mutants until Carmody was defeated. This explanation placated their parents and, once they were reunited with their \"normal\" children, their minds healed themselves. The \"clones\", which had been generated by Mirage, were then removed, making the children's secret safe once again.<ref name=\"Power Pack #44\">''Power Pack'' #44</ref> This \"cover-up\" proved to be unpopular with readers, and was highly criticized in the comic's letters column.\n\nAnother occasional member of the team was [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], the son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], who went by the name Tattletale while adventuring. James and Margaret Power were introduced to Franklin after the events of the Snark Wars,<ref>''Power Pack'' #26</ref> and befriended Reed and Sue Richards when Franklin was returned to [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #28</ref> Subsequently, Franklin was often invited to stay with the Power family while his parents were away on missions.<ref>''Power Pack'' #36</ref> Although Franklin was a member of the group, the [[Fantastic Four]] had no knowledge of Power Pack until the end of the series; instead, they thought of the Power children simply as \"Franklin's friends\".<ref>''Power Pack'' #36, 52</ref>\n\n===End of the series===\nSometime later, Alex underwent a transformation into a Kymellian, and Margaret Power began losing her mind.<ref>''Power Pack'' #56\u201362</ref> The Power family sought help for Margaret and Alex in various places, beginning with Reed Richards' lab, but their efforts were disrupted by the [[Red Ghost (character)|Red Ghost]] and his super apes.\n\nThe Power family traveled to the UK to try to find help for Margaret and Alex, but the institute was overrun by [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] and they encountered Excalibur.<ref>''Excalibur'' #29</ref> After that the Powers visited the Caribbean. The children planned to enjoy the sun and sand while their father consulted with colleagues but found themselves confronted with what seemed to be an alien attack on the beach where they were relaxing.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Summer Special 1991''</ref>\n\nThe family decided to abandon New York and fly with Friday to New Kymellia to seek help for Alex and his mother.<ref name=\"Power Pack #62\">''Power Pack'' #62</ref>\n\nBoth Alex and his parents had been replaced by \"pseudoplasm\" doubles by a renegade Kymellian Technocrat and his ally, the exiled Maraud (called Meraud in this storyline). The real Alex and his parents were being held captive in the Technocrat's hidden satellite orbiting New Kymellia. Eventually, the other Power siblings learned the truth and rescued their family, switching powers several times as needed, and barely escaping from the satellite before it was destroyed by Maraud.<ref name=pphs>''Power Pack Holiday Special'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter recovering on New Kymellia, the Power family returned to New York with Friday. Each of the children was back in possession of his or her original power, and their parents remained unaware of their children's powers and of Power Pack's existence.<ref name=\"pphs\" />\n\n==Post-series==\n===Alex, New Warriors and the Future Foundation===\nThe Kymellians had given Alex the ability to absorb the powers of his siblings into himself and thus use them all. With these powers, he joined the [[New Warriors]] superhero group under the name Powerpax, later Powerhouse.<ref>''New Warriors'' #48\u201351, 55\u201357</ref> This caused some friction with Alex's brother and sisters; even their parents noticed the heightened levels of hostility and forced the children to see a psychologist. Alex eventually gave the others' powers back; the four reverted to their original names (except Alex, who named himself ''Zero-G'' and Julie, who was now called ''Starstreak'', the name Katie had chosen when she had Julie's powers).<ref>Between ''New Warriors'' #75, ''Power Pack'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] later tried to recruit Alex back into the New Warriors.

She joined [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]], a support group for \"former\" teenage superheroes, where she is once again known as Lightspeed. Excelsior's first mission was to return the members of the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] to the foster care from which the children had absconded and ended with Excelsior battling [[Ultron]].<ref>''Runaways'' (vol. 2) #1\u20136</ref> Though they are not seen on-panel, it is then established that Excelsior spend several months attempting to recapture the child cast of the Runaways, but are constantly thwarted by being ineffectual, getting roped into cleaning up after the Runaways' crimefighting exploits, and on occasion simply by being outsmarted by the Runaways.<ref>''Runaways'' (vol. 2) #6\u201312</ref>\n\nThe Loners are all registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, but consider themselves retired from super-heroics<ref>''Loners'' #3</ref> when they are not battling superpowered menaces<ref>''Runaways'' (vol. 2) #6</ref> or operating in public as superheroes attempting to capture runaway superpowered children.<ref>''Runaways'' (vol. 2) #7</ref> However, Julie later tells the rest of the group that she is not registered.<ref>''Loners'' #5</ref> While she is less intelligent and articulate than previously established, Julie reveals in ''Loners'' #4 that this is merely an affectation she adopts for the benefit of others&nbsp;\u2013 she pretends to be a \"dumb blonde\" to fit in with Los Angelenos.<ref>'' Loners'' #4</ref> It had previously been established that Julie is a redhead, her \"blonde\" hair the result of using light hues in the production of the comic's art to reflect the brighter climate of the west coast.\n\nThe Loners' support group has moved to New York City, where Julie is presumably seen, though not named, at recent meetings.<ref>''War of Kings: Darkhawk'' #1\u20132</ref> As with the cast's sudden relocation to Los Angeles from New York between the cancellation of their series and the beginning of ''Runaways'' volume 2, the move is not explained.\n\nJulie was seen among the other young superheroes to arrive on the new campus for the [[Avengers Academy]],<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #20</ref> where she is attending classes as a teacher assistant, under [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver's]] tutelage.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21</ref>\n\nSometime after Julie ended the relationship with [[Karolina Dean]],<ref>''Runaways'' (Volume 5) #10</ref> she was dealing with her depression and dropping out of college; when Alex & [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]] appeared in her apartment and recruited her on a rescue mission to help save the Foundation. Afterward, she joined the team as both teacher and Co-leader of the FF.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (Volume 6) #12</ref>\n\n==Members==\nThe Power siblings have changed powers on several occasions and are the core of the Pack.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Written by [[Marc Sumerak]] and penciled by [[Gurihiru Studios]], it mostly ignored previous ''Power Pack'' continuity and was aimed toward young children. Marvel later noted that these stories take place on Earth-5631 as opposed to the established mainstream Marvel continuity of Earth-616.<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' #10</ref> Although the initial four-issue series was not released under the Marvel Age imprint because of editorial decisions, it was later reprinted in digest format under the Marvel Age banner. Each of these first four issues focussed on one of the Power children and their respective troubles in balancing the secret of their powers with the demands of their daily lives.\n\nA second ''Power Pack'' miniseries by the same creative team, ''X-Men & Power Pack'', debuted in October 2005. The series guest-starred various members and villains from the [[X-Men]] comics, including [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Mister Sinister]] and his [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The [[Circus of Crime#Modern day|Circus of Crime]] also makes an appearance.\n\nA third ''Power Pack'' miniseries, titled ''Avengers & Power Pack: Assemble!'' debuted in April 2006. This series teamed the Pack with various members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]: [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. Issues #3 & #4 were a two-part adventure in which the Pack and the Avengers battled [[Kang the Conqueror]], although the latter's plot of conquest which culminates in these two volumes spans the whole miniseries.\n\nA fourth ''Power Pack'' miniseries, titled ''Spider-Man & Power Pack'', debuted in November 2006. The series featured Spider-Man and some of his rogue's gallery, such as the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. The miniseries included two sub-plots: in one, Spider-Man was reduced in age and temporarily joined the Power siblings; the second involved the group teaming up with Spidey to capture Venom symbiote costumes that had been taking control of various women \u2013 including [[Mary-Jane Watson]] \u2013 during part one, and then Katie in part two.\n\nA fifth ''Power Pack'' miniseries, ''Hulk & Power Pack'', debuted in March 2007, following the events of the ''Spider-Man and Power Pack'' miniseries. The series involved the [[Hulk]] and his enemies the [[Absorbing Man]], [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and [[Zzzax]]. The miniseries was drawn by David Williams (except for issue #3, which was drawn by Andy Kuhn).\n\nA sixth ''Power Pack'' miniseries, ''Fantastic Four & Power Pack'', debuted in July 2007, co-starring the Fantastic Four, who made a previous appearance in issue #3 of the first ''Power Pack'' miniseries. Gurihiru Studios returned for the artwork; however, [[Fred Van Lente]] replaced Mark Sumerak as writer. The series pitted the Pack against the Fantastic Four's enemies and also featured Franklin Richards, who, as Tattletale, was a member of Power Pack in the regular Marvel Universe.\n\nA seventh ''Power Pack'' miniseries, ''Iron Man & Power Pack'', debuted in November 2007, co-starring Iron Man, who had previously appeared in the ''Avengers & Power Pack: Assemble!'' miniseries. The series was written by Marc Sumerak and the artwork was by Marcelo Diachara. Opponents include the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]], the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], [[Blizzard (Marvel Comics)|Blizzard]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] and [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]]. [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] and [[Pepper Potts]] also have guest appearances.\n\nAn eighth ''Power Pack'' miniseries, titled ''Power Pack: Day One'' debuted in March 2008. The series, which featured the same creative team as ''Fantastic Four & Power Pack'' (Fred Van Lente and Gurihiru), focused on the origins of the team and the incorporation of their new member, Franklin Richards. This series is credited as being \"based on\" the origin tale from the 1984 series by Louise Simonson and June Brigman, though it is lighter in tone, has a shorter page-count, and changes some plot elements. The series also included scientific back-up information about the physical aspects of the siblings' powers, with artwork by Colleen Coover.\n\nA ninth series, ''Skrulls vs Power Pack'', made its debut in July 2008. The storyline involved Power Pack encountering the alien [[Skrull]]s. This miniseries also introduced the Kymellian Kofi Whitemane to this continuity. The creative team was Fred Van Lente as writer and Cory Hamscher as artist. Gurihiru provided the covers and the colors.\n\nA tenth miniseries, ''Wolverine and Power Pack'', made its debut in November 2008. Wolverine had previously appeared in the ''X-Men and Power Pack'' miniseries. The series reunited the original creative team of Marc Sumerak and Gurihiru. Logan and the four children confronted [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], faced the [[Danger Room]], and defended the Xavier school against [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], giant robots programmed for anti-mutant genocide. Since the Power siblings are not actually mutants, their intervention was decisive in the outcome of the latter battle. Logan and Power Pack have adventures together in 19th-century New York City and 20th-century Tokyo.\n\nAn eleventh Power Pack miniseries began in April 2010, with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] appearing and co-headlining, called ''Thor And The Warriors Four''. The creative team is writer Alex Zalben and artwork once again by Gurihiru. Thor and the Power children confront an evil plot of [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]'s while trying to save the Powers' grandmother. High points include Alex wielding [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], [[Beta Ray Bill]] and the other [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] turning into children, a guest appearance by [[Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers]], and Dr. Donald Blake making applesauce. The series also contains a back-up adventure of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] telling [[Hercules#In mythology|the story of his Twelve Labors]] while babysitting the Pack.\n\n===Mini Marvels===\nIn a ''[[Mini Marvels]]'' short, [[Spider-Man]] is hired to babysit the infant Power children.\n\n===House of M===\nAlex and Julie appear in ''[[House of M]]: Avengers'' #3 as members of a superpowered gang called the Wolfpack, the House of M's version of the [[New Warriors]].\n\n===Marvel 2099===\nIn the alternate ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' timeline, Julie, Jack, and Kate appear as adults, apparently having aged at a greatly reduced rate as a result of their powers. [[Alchemax]] CEO [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hires them to take down Captain America 2099 and [[Spider-Man 2099]].<ref>''Spider-Man'' vol. 3, #14\u201315</ref> Eventually, it is revealed that they are actually [[Skrull]]s who have been brainwashed into believing they are Power Pack.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 3, #16</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nThe zombified Power children appear in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #3. They come into conflict with [[Nextwave]], who have not been infected at that point but are ruthlessly dispatched off-panel moments later. An explosion violently kills all of them but Alex, who appears in ''Marvel Zombies Halloween'' with other zombies attacking Kitty Pryde and her son Peter.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Halloween'' #1 (one-shot)</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nKatie, going by Kate, appears in issues 2\u20135 of ''[[A-Next]]''. During a conversation with [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]], she indicates that something tragic happened to one of her brothers, but the details of the situation remain unclear.\n\n===Millennial Visions===\nIn the \"Power Pack: Starting Over\" story within Marvel's 2001 ''Millennial Visions'' one-shot comic, the team is depicted as a group of adults ranging from 25 (Katie) to 32 (Alex). In this alternate universe, the siblings split up after their parents were killed by anti-mutant activists and led disparate lives until Julie reunites them to face a new Snark attack.<ref>''Millennial Visions'', Marvel, 2001</ref>\n\n===New Mutants===\nIn an issue of ''[[New Mutants]]'', Katie appears in a dystopian future ruled by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #49</ref> She has all of her siblings' powers, explaining that this is because they were killed some time ago. She fights for the rights of downtrodden humans and helps the time-lost members of the New Mutants find their way home.\n\n===Renew Your Vows===\nThe siblings appear in the miniseries ''Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' as schoolmates of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker's]] daughter Annie. They are forced to go into hiding when it is discovered that they have superhuman abilities and are taken in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' vol. 1 #2\u20134</ref>\n\n===X-Force===\nA young girl called Francine Power appears in an alternate future in ''[[X-Force]] Annual'' #1, operating under the name Powerpax. She has all of the powers of the various members of Power Pack and wears a costume similar to the one later worn by Alex Power in the pages of ''New Warriors''.\n\n==Collected editions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

The 27-minute pilot has subsequently been aired a few times on [[Fox Kids]] during the off-season.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Webber|url=https://www.cbr.com/16-forgotten-comic-book-tv-specials/|title=16 Forgotten Comic Book TV Specials|work=Comic Book Resources|date=December 19, 2016|access-date=July 24, 2018}}</ref> Minor alterations to the concept were made for the pilot, ranging from the children's parents being aware of their superhuman abilities, Julie's acceleration power being altered to her being able to move at superhuman speed, without the ability to fly, and the \"cloud\" aspect of Jack's density power being eliminated; he was only able to shrink in size. The children did not wear costumes.\n\n===Other television appearances===\n* All four members of Power Pack (Alex, Julie, Jack, and Katie) have cameo appearances alongside [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode \"Support Your Local Sky-Father!\".\n* The name Power Pack is mentioned in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode \"Blade and the Howling Commandos\".
