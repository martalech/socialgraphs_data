Escaping capture after [[World War II]], he was a [[beekeeper]] or ''apiarist'' in [[South America]] and discovered a colony of mutated [[bee]]s. Intrigued by their intelligence and passive nature, von Meyer attempted to enslave the queen bee but failed and the bees devoured him, leaving only his skeleton. The bees' unique qualities caused von Meyer's consciousness to be absorbed into them, allowing him to manipulate the hive to do his will while his skeletal remains are inside the swarm itself. His consciousness merged with the hive to the extent that they are one being, calling himself/themselves \"Swarm\".<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=334}}</ref>\n\nSwarm battled the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]].<ref>''The Champions'' #14\u201315 (1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> After being defeated, Swarm resurfaced to battle [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #36\u201337. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the first of many fights, Spider-Man prevailed against him when the web-slinger's costume was dosed in a new type of [[insecticide]] that hurt the bees if they got too close. Swarm lost his/their skeleton in this battle but returned to fight again (no longer having the skeleton but still possessing von Meyer's consciousness), first teaming with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] and [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]],<ref>''Spider-Man Family Amazing Friends'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> then against Spider-Man,<ref>''The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #3\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref> but feedback from a weapon fired by the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] caused Swarm's bee body to disperse temporarily.\n\nSwarm next appears when a Super-Collider from [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand Industries]] is activated and called his/their attention.<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #18</ref> Swarm decides mankind should be exterminated so insects can rule the world. [[Doctor Druid]] convinced Swarm that mankind will exterminate themselves and the age of insects can begin.<ref>''Secret Defenders'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, Swarm was tired of waiting and returned to New York, after a psychic wave generated by [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] disrupted the psychic field that bonded him and the bees together. He forced a group of scientists investigating energy fields to help him not only restore his original field, but expand it to grant him control of every bee on Earth. As [[New York City]] is invaded by bees, the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] tracked the bees to their destination and \u2014 taking advantage of the fact that the swarms' instinctive memory of Raid caused the bees to automatically flinch away from Spider-Man \u2014 infiltrated the building to contact the scientists. By claiming that the scientists' equipment is having trouble broadcasting a sufficiently powerful signal through the dome of bees, Scarlet Spider is able to trick Swarm into allowing a device's construction designed to negate the vibrational frequency that the bees create to allow themselves to fly, presenting it as a means of boosting the existing signal's power. With the bees now grounded, Scarlet Spider subsequently recovers the queen of Swarm's hive and leaves the authorities' care, reasoning Swarm won't be a future threat without her.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #9\u201310. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNow back with an internal skeleton, Swarm felt that the criminal organization [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]'s fall allowed access to their former territory, specifically [[Los Angeles]]. However, he/they are defeated by the Los Angeles' protector [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] when his/their body of bees' mental link is disrupted by electrical blasts.<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSwarm regained control over his colony and joins the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s Exterminators to kill their shared enemy now that Peter Parker's true identity is revealed. Swarm attacks [[Mary Jane Watson]] but the latter sprays Swarm with water while a co-worker smashes Swarm's skeleton, but the bees reformed around the skeleton as [[Stark Industries]]' bodyguards take him/them away.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWhen [[Kraven the Hunter|Alyosha Kravinoff]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Swarm is in one of the cages.<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> He fought [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] as the [[Punisher]] passes them and escaped.\n\nSwarm next turns up in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], having amassed enough bees to become giant-sized. The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] face him/them unsuccessfully until [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] devours Swarm's bones. [[Norman Osborn]] speculated this is a minor inconvenience that shouldn't prevent Swarm's return.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Thunderbolts'' #122. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSwarm next turns up in [[Buenos Aires]], having his intelligence again. He fought the [[Mighty Avengers (comics)|Mighty Avengers]] by creating 'avatars' made of bees. [[Hank Pym]], [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] and [[Amadeus Cho]] place an inhibitor collar on the queen bees which caused Swarm's intelligence to somehow disperse.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #24</ref>\n\nHe was briefly seen trying to launch an attack of the [[Jean Grey|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] only to be almost instantly thwarted by the [[X-Men]]'s [[Krakoa]], the [[Bamf]]s, and [[Doop (comics)|Doop]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSwarm later formed his own incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]] with [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]], [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Melter]] and [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]]. They attack Spider-Man and the students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Swarm gets dispersed by [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] which caused the other members to surrender.<ref name=\"Spider-Man and the X-Men #4\"/>\n\nSwarm later attacked New York but was defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and her ally Koi Boi covering him with water and turning bags full of his constituent bees in to the police.<ref name=\"Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7\">''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSwarm later appeared as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Ox (comics)|Ox]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. During the disastrous battle against Spider-Man and [[Deadpool]], the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSwarm relocates to Florida, where he encounters Macrothrax and his minions who are also sentient insect colonies in humanoid form, accidentally created by the invention behind him. He ends up joining forces with [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and taking a liking to the latter.<ref>''Ant-Man'' #1-2 (February & March 2020). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSwarm is a composite being of hundreds of thousands of bees driven by a human intelligence. He is technically intangible, as his body is merely an aggregate of tiny forms. He can fly through the air and assume any shape and size he desires. He can mentally influence the actions of other bees, the full range of which may extend over hundreds of yards in radius. With the aid of a team of scientists, Swarm was briefly able to enhance his power to the point where he could have theoretically taken control of every bee on Earth, but this plan was averted by Spider-Man. At first, Swarm seemed capable of only controlling other bees, but he has exhibited the ability to communicate/control other insects as well. Fritz von Meyer's skeleton, the focal point of his consciousness, remained behind as his only remains until being devoured by Venom.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Marvel Fairy Tales''===\nIn the second issue of the Spider-Man line of ''[[Marvel Fairy Tales]]'' (an adaptation of the legend of [[Anansi]]), an alternate version of Swarm appears as the stories' main villain, the Yellow and purple spider.<ref>{{Cite comic\n | Writer = C.

He/they supposedly wanted to take over the world (or at least kill a few jocks), but it looked like he/they just wanted some ice cream.<ref>''Marvel Adventures'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of Swarm is '''Petra Laskov''', a [[Syria]]n female [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. She was the wife of Georgian activist Nikolai Laskov. The couple's child is held at gunpoint, forcing Laskov to kill her husband to save her own child. She does so, only for Laskov's child to be killed anyway, and then Laskov was raped by thugs.<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #5\"/> Years later, she appears as the supervillainess '''Insect Queen'''<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #5\">''Ultimate Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> of the supervillain [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]] group that invades the United States to kill many in order to put a stop to perceived American aggression. During a showdown with the [[Ultimates]], Laskov is apparently killed after being stomped by the giant-sized [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, she is later rebuilt as the [[superhero]]ine '''Red-Wasp''' by [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and [[Gregory Stark]] to be a member of their Avengers team.<ref name=\"Ultimate Comics: Avengers #3\">''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Avengers fight the [[Ian Rogers (comics)|Red Skull]], Laskov is tormented until [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] save the team. Afterwards, Laskov (disguised as a nurse) shoots her family's executioner in the head in a hospital.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her abilities as the inhuman-esque Swarm are to control insects (albeit fully corporeal) with [[Margali Szardos]]'s similar features of grey skin and horns while her abilities as the human-looking Red-Wasp is an aggressive variation of the Wasp.\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nThe [[Marvel Noir]] universe's equivalent is '''Madame Sturm''', a Nazi scientist. She finds the same Spider-God totem behind Peter Parker's powers which she uses to mutate herself into a bee god and calls herself '''Madame Swarm'''. She is defeated when [[Spider-Man Noir]] lures her towards a Nazi blimp that [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] blows up with the Venom sting.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* A variation of Swarm appeared in a self-titled episode of the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' animated series, voiced by Al Fann.<ref name=\"BTVA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Swarm/|title = Swarm Voices (Spider-Man)}}</ref> This version was originally a beehive irradiated by a fallen meteorite's energy, gaining sentience as well as the ability to increase other bees' size and mutate humans into insect hybrid drones. It attempts to spread its hive mind throughout the universe until [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]], and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] intervene and launch the meteorite back into space to reverse Swarm's effects.\n* Another variation of Swarm named '''Michael Tan''' appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/122/1223457p1.html | title= Ultimate Spider-Man: Make Way for Iron Man! | first= Eric | last= Goldman | date= 20 April 2012| publisher= IGN.com | access-date= 23 May 2013}}</ref> voiced by [[Eric Bauza]] (in \"Swarm\"),<ref>{{cite episode|title=Swarm|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=11|airdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"BTVA\"/> and [[Drake Bell]] (in \"Sandman Returns\").<ref>{{cite episode|title=Sandman Returns|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=24|airdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"BTVA\"/> This version utilizes a swarm of self-replicating nanobots. Debuting in his self-titled episode, Tan started out as a disgruntled and immature employee of Stark Industries who worked on a device to control technology, only to be fired by [[Iron Man]]. He activates the device in retaliation, which fuses his molecules with Spider-Man's spider-tracer and activates when the web-slinger attempts to use it on the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. As Swarm, Tan attempts to assimilate Iron Man's technology, but Spider-Man and Iron Man are able to defeat him by using the former's spider-tracer and the latter's arc reactor to amplify a nullifying frequency. With Swarm neutralized, his nanobots are confiscated for his reconfiguration. In \"Sandman Returns\", Swarm attempts to assimilate [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] technology, but is defeated by Spider-Man and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. In \"HYDRA Attacks\" Pt. 1, Swarm is a prisoner on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]] before [[Doctor Octopus]]'s miniature Octobot combined with Swarm's nanobots to convert the headquarters into [[Arnim Zola]]'s [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] Island.\n* The Fritz von Meyer incarnation of Swarm appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Adventures]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]].<ref name=\"BTVA\"/>\n* A variation of Swarm appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man: Maximum Venom]]'' animated series as the alter-ego of '''[[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]]''' (voiced by [[Alex D\u00e9sert]]), utilizing purple nanotech bees that grant him a solid form and can use their stingers to mind control humans.<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE INFORMATION.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Toys===\nAn [[action figure]] of the Fritz von Meyer incarnation of Swarm was released in 1997 as part of the ''Spider-Man: Spider Force'' toy line. It was molded in a translucent yellow plastic and featured a removable cape and hood as well as snap-on bee armor which could also be assembled to create a \"giant\" bee accessory.\n\n===Theatre===\nThe Fritz von Meyer incarnation of Swarm appears in the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', played by Gerald Avery. This version was originally a scientist at [[Oscorp]] before he's manipulated into being Swarm by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] and joining the Sinister Six.\n\n==Reception==\nIn August 2009, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' listed Swarm as one of the \"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/09/02/top-10-oddest-marvel-characters/slide/swarm/|title=Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters|date=August 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSwarm was ranked #29 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters|title= Marvel's 31 Best Monsters|first= Marc|last= Buxton|date= October 30, 2015|publisher= [[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231247/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters|archive-date= September 30, 2018|url-status= live|df= mdy-all|quote= Swarm is a very obscure villain who made his debut in the pages of ''The Champions'' of all places.
