She later returned to the Serpent Society.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\nShe was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Paul Neary]], and first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310, published October 1985.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIntelligent yet soft-spoken, Asp was born in [[Tanta]], [[Egypt]]. It was there that she earned her reputation as an [[exotic dancer]], being able to charm snakes with her sensual movements. Her ability to generate blasts of energy which cause paralysis intrigued the leader of the Serpent Society, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], and he invited her to join the group.<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref>\n\nGiven the task to spread the word of a new criminal organization to those who would be interested brought Asp and her comrade, [[Cottonmouth (Burchell Clemens)|Cottonmouth]], straight to the notorious [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Captain America'' #311</ref> She also participated in the mission to murder [[MODOK]], though she was defeated when [[Captain America]] entered the battle.<ref>''Captain America'' #313</ref> She was not as cold-hearted as some of her teammates, though she didn't hesitate to get down and dirty with the best of them.

During a battle with Iron Fist, Sabretooth, and Choshin's samurais, Asp was knocked out of the battle.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #74-75 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAsp has the ability to generate a unique form of radiant [[bioelectricity]] that she can channel as lightning-like blasts. This energy does not affect inanimate matter, but upon striking a living being causes a rapid paralysis of the nervous system similar to the effect of the [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] bite of certain [[venomous snakes]]. Her body constantly generates and stores this energy, but it can be temporarily expended after firing several \"venom-bolts\" in rapid succession, requiring her to recharge. Asp can accelerate the speed at which her body regenerates energy by engaging in physical activity that increases her heart rate and metabolism.\n\nAsp's \"venom-bolts\" have different effects, depending on how far they travel before reaching a target, and on how much power she uses in a single bolt. A full-force blast can instantly kill an adult human. Normally, however, her bolts paralyze her victims for several hours, but cause no lasting damage. She can also release blasts of lower intensity that do not instantly paralyze targets, but instead cause neural delays which result in a loss of muscular control and coordination. Her energy bolts can travel roughly twenty-five feet before dissipating.\n\nWhen fully charged, the Asp's body releases low levels of energy at all times, making prolonged physical contact with her fatal. She can also apparently release a blast of paralytic energy through physical contact without any visible effect.\n\nThe Asp is also an accomplished dancer with superb muscular control.\n\n==Other characters named Asp==\nA thief named the Asp (real name Rich Harper) appeared with the [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] in the ''[[Supernatural Thrillers]]'' series.
