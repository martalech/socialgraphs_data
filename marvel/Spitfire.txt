As Spitfire, she possesses the ability to run at lightning-fast speeds, with reflexes, reactions, coordination, agility, and endurance to match. When she runs, a trail of non-damaging fire appears behind her. She can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Her skin is also hardened to withstand the rigors of such speed, providing a type of body armor, and her costume is synthetic stretch fabric chemically treated for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed.\n\nIn the years after World War II, as Spitfire aged she ceased the use of her superhuman speed. Due to a second transfusion of artificial blood from the original Human Torch, Spitfire today has the body of a teenage girl, although she is chronologically many decades older. Her hair was originally still white from age, but it began turning blonde again.\n\nIt is said by the mutant sorceress, Selene, that Spitfire seems to possess a mutant regenerative power triggered by her transfusion of synthetic blood. With intensive study of her metabolism, blood stream, and glandular system, Selene hoped to one day duplicate the process.<ref name=\"MCP89\"/>\n\nShe has some vampire abilities including fangs that appear when she is angry. However, she feels no blood lust and has no need to drink blood.  She has shown superhuman strength sufficient enough to break a sword made out of titanium and also displayed a healing factor, as she was able to heal a broken back and ribs in a few panels.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nSpitfire is a trained airplane pilot and exceptional athlete and hand-to-hand combatant, utilizing her ability to move at superhuman speeds, due to training by the original [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] and [[Captain America]].\n\n==Collected editions==\nSpitfire's major appearances have been collected in a number of [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]:\n\n* ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] Classic'' (written by [[Roy Thomas]], with pencils by [[Frank Robbins]] and inks by [[Vince Colletta]]/[[Frank Springer]]):\n** ''Volume 1'' (includes ''Invaders'' #1-9, July - October 1976, tpb, 248 pages, July 2007, {{ISBN|0-7851-2706-2}})\n** ''Volume 2'' (includes ''Invaders'' #10-21, November 1976 - October 1977, tpb, 240 pages, July 2008, {{ISBN|0-7851-3120-5}})\n* ''[[Captain America]]: War and Remembrance'' (by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Roger Stern]], with pencils by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inks by [[Josef Rubinstein]], TPB includes ''Captain America'' #253-254, 1981, 208 pages, July 2007, {{ISBN|0-7851-2693-7}})\n* ''Union Jack'' (written by [[John Cassaday]] and [[Ben Raab]], with art by [[John Cassaday]], 3-issue mini-series, December 1998 - February 1999, TPB, 96 pages, April 2002, {{ISBN|0-7851-0934-X}})\n* ''[[New Invaders]]: To End All Wars'' (written by [[Allan Jacobsen (comics)|Allan Jacobsen]], with art by [[Jorge Lucas]] and [[C.
