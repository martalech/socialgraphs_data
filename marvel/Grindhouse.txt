The team first appeared in ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #54 (December 1978), and was created by [[Ed Hannigan]] and [[Lee Elias]]. The team continued to appear in comics regularly over the years, and has made guest appearances in television productions and game environments featuring other superheroes.\n\n==Publication history and original concept==\nThe Heroes for Hire concept originated with solo series titled ''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire''. As a \"hero for hire\", Cage tried to merge the usually [[pro bono]] world of superheroics with the bill-paying practicality of private investigation. Although the title changed to ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' in issue #17, Cage continued with his for-hire activities.\n\nInitially, Heroes for Hire, Inc. was a small business licensed by the state of New York that offered a full line of professional investigation and protection services. Heroes for Hire was owned by Luke Cage and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Daniel Rand (Iron Fist).]] It had offices on Park Avenue and two paid employees: Jenny Royce, the group's secretary, and Jeryn Hogarth, the group's lawyer and business representative. Heroes for Hire would not accept jobs that involved extra-legal activities.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n===Power Man and Iron Fist===\nHis own series cancelled due to low sales, Iron Fist joined the cast of ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' in a three-part storyline in #48\u201350. The comic's name changed to ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' from #50 upwards.  The two formed a new Heroes for Hire, Inc., founded by attorney [[Jeryn Hogarth]] and staffed by administrative wunderkind Jennie Royce. Iron Fist supporting cast characters [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]] also often appeared, although never becoming official members. This partnership lasted until the series' final issue #125, with Cage blamed for the apparent death of Iron Fist.\n\n===Heroes for Hire (1996)===\nIn 1996, as a consequence of the \"[[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]\" and \"[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]\" storylines, the [[Marvel Universe]] suffered a power vacuum after the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] were presumed killed. Following up on the status of the Oracle Corporation that [[Namor]] had set up in the pages of ''Namor'', Jim Hammond (the [[Human Torch (android)|Golden Age Human Torch]]) and Danny Rand decided to set up a new Heroes for Hire organization. Iron Fist recruited Luke Cage for this. '''''Heroes for Hire''''' debuted in 1997, with a core team consisting of Iron Fist, Cage, and an assortment of hangers-on: [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)]], a new [[White Tiger (Heroes for Hire)|White Tiger]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]], the original Human Torch, and even [[Deadpool]] were included in the cast of the book, though much of the cast rotated in a ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]''-like manner, hired for missions as necessary. ''Heroes for Hire'' was written by [[John Ostrander]] and illustrated by [[Pasqual Ferry]]. It lasted for 19 issues before it was cancelled.\n\n===Heroes for Hire (2006)===\nA new ''Heroes for Hire'' series was developed as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of 2006's ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline. The book was initially written by [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Justin Gray]] (with art by [[Billy Tucci]]) who also wrote the Daughters of the Dragon mini-series starring Misty and Colleen. Many characters and plots followed from this series into Heroes for Hire. The series then changed hands and was written by [[Zeb Wells]], with art by Terry Pallot.\nThe team roster for the book is [[Colleen Wing]], [[Misty Knight]], the new [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Maria Vasquez|Tarantula]], [[Shang-Chi]], [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]], [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], the latter two joining for money. They serve as enforcers for the Superhuman Registration Act. After the murder of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] in battle against the [[Ragnarok (comics)|Cyborg Clone of Thor]], they made plans to take on [[Captain America]].\n\nAfter learning Captain America's location from a [[Pixiu]], the team (minus Orka and Tarantula) tracks him down. While Misty and the team just want to talk and find a peaceful solution, Paladin betrays them. Paladin disables the team with knockout gas and attempts to capture Captain America. Shang-Chi's martial arts training had allowed him to hold his breath long enough to avoid the effects of the gas. Shang-Chi defeats Paladin and switches his uniform with Captain America. When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrives, Paladin is unintentionally taken into custody.\n\nShortly thereafter, Captain America and the Heroes for Hire part ways, and the \"anti-regs\" abandon their now compromised base. Meanwhile, the Heroes for Hire discover a black-market operation that surgically implanted superhumans with [[Skrull]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] that would endow those who had the [[Organ transplant|operation]] with Skrull shapeshifting abilities. Several of these hybrid Skrull-villains bust Misty Knight's old foe [[Ricadonna]] from prison. Ricadonna destroys the Heroes' headquarters by sending an explosive package, and puts hits out on the entire team. Most notable of these were Insecticide (the hit man sent to kill Humbug &mdash; Humbug neutralized him with help from his pet [[Africanized bee|killer bees]]), Shadow Stalker (an old foe of Shang-Chi sent to kill him\u2014Shang-Chi quickly humiliated him), and the gang of ninjas that attacked Tarantula when she was with her father. After they murder her father, Tarantula kills the entire gang herself. The team splits up in search of Ricadonna; while Misty Knight and Colleen Wing try to shake up Toddler for information, Humbug uses his flies to discover Ricadonna's base\u2014and also that she has somehow gained superpowers.\n\nThe team also comes into conflict with [[Grindhouse (comics)|Grindhouse]],<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #1</ref> the [[Headmen]], and encounter [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy]] in the [[Savage Land]]. Following these adventures, the Heroes for Hire became involved in \"[[World War Hulk]]\", being captured aboard [[Hulk]]'s stone ship. Humbug turns on the group, but in turn is betrayed by Earth's hive, which had been using him from the start. Colleen and Tarantula are heavily tortured, but are rescued by the rest of the team. Shang-Chi kills Humbug to avenge Tarantula's torture, and possibly out of mercy, as Humbug had mutated into a grotesque monster and was in great pain. Afterward the team splits up, with Paladin taking Moon-boy in for the reward offered for his capture. Black Cat tries to appeal to Paladin's good nature, but Paladin kicks her away and informs her she does not know him at all. Shang-Chi departs the group carrying the still injured Tarantula in his arms. Misty attempts to console a still heavily distraught Colleen, trying to encourage her that the team could still keep going, but Colleen will hear none of it. Colleen states that the moment the team sold their service as heroes they sold the best part of themselves. Colleen walks away leaving Misty alone, signaling the complete end of team.\n\n===Heroes for Hire (2010)===\nIn 2010, Marvel debuted a new Heroes for Hire series. The book spins off from the aftermath of the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/all.14034 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130128140446/http://marvel.com/news/all.14034 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-28 |title=News |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date=2011-02-11 }}</ref>  This time, the team is run more like an organization, with revolving members, each hero in regards to the mission. Unlike previous incarnations, members work for benefits such as crime tips and backup when needed as opposed to money.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 3 #1-5</ref> The organization is originally run by a mind controlled [[Misty Knight]] with a team that includes [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Punisher]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Silver Sable]], and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. After Paladin and Iron Fist free Misty from mind control, the other members find out and lose faith in the organization. Paladin convinces Misty to restart the operation from the ground up with him and earn the respect of the superhero community.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 3 #5 (2010)</ref> The first to rejoin the operation is [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 3 #8</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Spider-Island]]\" storyline, Heroes for Hire is called in by Mayor [[J. Jonah Jameson]] into helping to quarantine Manhattan after an outbreak that caused anyone exposed to the bites of genetically-engineered bedbugs to develop spider-like powers. Heroes for Hire ended up fighting spider-powered versions of [[Chemistro#Calvin Carr|Chemistro]], Cheshire Cat, Commanche, [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]], Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton, [[Mr. Fish#Bill Norris|Mr. Fish]], [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]], and Spear.<ref>''Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire'' #1</ref>\n\n===Villains for Hire (2011)===\nIn a new series spinning out of events from the end of ''Heroes for Hire'', Misty Knight leads a new group of heroes consisting of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Silver Sable]], and Paladin. However, through yet known circumstances, she forms a sub-group of villains consisting of [[Bombshell (Marvel Comics)|Bombshell]], [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]], and [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ifanboy.com/articles/sdcc-2011-exclusive-abnett-lanning-on-villains-for-hire/ |title=SDCC 2011 Exclusive: Abnett + Lanning on Villains for Hire |author=Richards, Ron |date=July 21, 2011 |publisher=iFanboy |access-date=September 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Villains for Hire team was led by [[Purple Man]] and [[Headhunter (comics)|Headhunter]] and the line-up consists of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Death-Stalker#Death-Stalker (Villain for Hire)|Death-Stalker]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and Scourge.

During the fight, Lady Stilt-Man defects to Purple Man's side as Bombshell, [[Man-Ape]], and Tiger Shark joins as well. Misty Knight reveals that she gained the assistance of [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] who uses the criminals on Misty Knight's side as part of Puppet Master's payback on Purple Man, and that the Scourge working for the Purple Man was actually Paladin working undercover.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #3 & 4</ref>\n\n===Mighty Avengers (2013)===\nDuring the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'', Luke Cage is shown leading a new Heroes for Hire roster consisting of himself, [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] and [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]]. The team dissolves after White Tiger quits when the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) considered the team mercenaries following a fight with [[Plunderer (comics)|Plunderer]]. The remnants of the group go on to form the new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] during [[Thanos]]'s invasion of Earth.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n===Deadpool's \"Heroes for Hire\" (2015)===\n{{main|Mercs for Money}}\nEight months after the events of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline as seen during the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, [[Deadpool]] establishes a new team of Heroes for Hire.
