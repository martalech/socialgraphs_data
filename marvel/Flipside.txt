It was originally announced by [[Stan Lee]] in his \"[[Bullpen Bulletins|Stan's Soapbox]]\" column as a single series entitled ''The Marvel World of Tomorrow'', which was being developed by Lee and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. This later changed to a [[line (comics)|line]] of books under the banner ''Marvel 2093'' (the date being one hundred years from the year in which the titles launched) before finally being published as ''Marvel 2099''.\n\nThree of the initial four titles launched\u2014''[[Doom 2099]]'', ''[[Punisher 2099]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]''\u2014starred futuristic takes on pre-existing characters. The fourth, ''[[Ravage 2099]]'', featured an all-new superhero, scripted for several months by [[Stan Lee]]. The 2099 [[line (comics)|line]] soon expanded to include ''2099 Unlimited'', ''[[Fantastic Four 2099]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider 2099]]'', ''[[Hulk 2099]]'', ''[[X-Men 2099]]'', and ''[[X-Nation 2099]]''. While it has been confirmed to be a possible future version of [[Earth-616]], the mainstream Marvel Universe, the 2099 universe has been officially designated as '''Earth-928''' and alternatively dubbed as '''Earth-616 circa 2099'''.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe initial universe began with ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'', ''[[Ravage 2099]]'', ''[[Doom 2099]]'', and ''[[Punisher 2099]]'' being launched in subsequent months. [[Peter David]] wrote ''Spider-Man'' for the bulk of the series, and it was consistently the most popular series.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} It satirized corporations, with Spider-Man constantly clashing with Alchemax, which employed him in his secret identity. Stan Lee wrote the first eight issues of ''Ravage'' as an extremely political story about corruption, corporate pollution, and the environment. After Lee left, he was replaced by a series of writers . In 1993, ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' reported that the 2099 line had \"gone over fairly well with the fans\".<ref>{{cite news | date = June 1993 | title = Wizard Market Watch | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 22 | pages = 134\u20135}}</ref>\n\n===Growth and decline===\nFans requested further titles, and Marvel provided ''[[X-Men 2099]]''. They also introduced a [[Hulk 2099]] in the series ''2099 Unlimited'', which featured occasional Spider-Man 2099 stories, as well as early work by [[Warren Ellis]]. The comics had a strong degree of interconnectivity that was similar to comics published by Marvel in the 1960s due to the imprint's editor Joey Cavalieri. The only cross-title crossover within the 2099 universe, ''The Fall of the Hammer'', detailed a plot by the corporations to technologically recreate the Norse pantheon, along with a new [[Thor (Marvel Comics)#2099|Thor]], to distract attention from the anti-corporate superheroes.\n\nThe 2099 series expanded to include ''[[Ghost Rider 2099]]'', about a hero whose consciousness had been downloaded into a robotic body. Hulk 2099 was also given a brief chance at his own series. As sales began to flag on all titles besides ''Spider-Man'' and ''X-Men'', Marvel commissioned ideas from various writers, including a proposal by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]], before accepting Warren Ellis's idea that Doom 2099, revealed to be, in fact, Victor Von Doom, would take over the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Each title had the modifier \"A.D.\" (\"After Doom\") added on the logo to reflect the change. The new storyline allowed Marvel to cancel several low-selling titles (''Hulk'', ''Ravage'',  and ''The Punisher'').{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The in-universe reason for the heroes' deaths was President Rogers (an impostor [[Captain America]] who was instated after Doom was violently ousted from office) ordered the execution of the super heroes, including Punisher, Hulk and a handful of low-tier heroes who had appeared in ''2099 Unlimited''.<ref>''2099 Apocalypse''. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, when Marvel, during a cost-cutting exercise, fired Cavalieri, many of the 2099 creators (including Peter David and Warren Ellis) quit the line in protest. With the line floundering, two additional titles were launched: ''[[X-Nation 2099]]'', a spin-off of ''X-Men 2099'', and ''[[Fantastic Four 2099]]'', which featured characters who were apparently the present day [[Fantastic Four]] accidentally sent into the future.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAround this time, ''Doom 2099'' became the only 2099 comic to crossover with a present-day Marvel comic when he traveled back to 1996 and met [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], the Fantastic Four, and [[Namor]] in a story partially told in ''Fantastic Four'' #413. Spider-Man 2099 met the original [[Spider-Man]] in a special one-shot issue, making them the only characters to meet their counterparts.\n\n===End of the imprint===\n{{update|Timestorm and the second Spider-Man title|date=October 2014}}\nAfter sales slumped, the 2099 titles were canceled and replaced by ''[[2099: World of Tomorrow]]'', a single title featuring the surviving characters from all the titles. The series lasted only eight issues before being canceled.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe 2099 line was concluded with a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''2099: Manifest Destiny'' (March 1998), in which Captain America was found in suspended animation and, with Miguel O'Hara, assembled various 2099 heroes into a new team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The story summarized the years from 2099 to 3099, with humanity transforming the corporate world of 2099 into a utopia and then expanding into space.\n\n===Subsequent appearances===\nThe 2099 world has been seen occasionally since, most notably in Peter David's \"Future Tense\" storyline in ''[[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'', which revisited both [[Spider-Man 2099]] and the alternate future of the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Maestro|Maestro]] that David created in ''[[Maestro (comics)|The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect]]'', explaining a plot point which had been left dangling since David had abruptly left ''Spider-Man 2099''.\n\nIn 2004, writer [[Robert Kirkman]] wrote a series of one-shot comics for the fifth anniversary of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint, under the heading ''[[Marvel Knights#Marvel Knights 2099|Marvel Knights 2099]]''. The future portrayed in this series is unconnected to the original 2099 Universe, which included a different Punisher 2099.\n\nIn 2005, the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' one-shot, involving alternate universes, designated the Earth of 2099 as Earth-928, with ''[[Marvel Knights#Marvel Knights 2099|Marvel Knights 2099]]'' designated as Earth-2992. A cover of a second printing from the Spider-Man storyline \"[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other: Evolve or Die]]\" features Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099.\n\nIn 2006, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] visited the Marvel Universe 2099 in ''Exiles'' #75-76 as part of the \"World Tour\" arc. This future had split apart from the mainstream 2099 fairly early, as Doom 2099 had not yet met Spider-Man 2099. Spider-Man 2099 joined the Exiles and left with them.\n\nIn 2009 Marvel published miniseries \"Timestorm,\" crossing the current Marvel Universe with yet another alternate version of 2099.  The Spider-Man 2099 of this reality is a teenager.\n\nIn 2013, Spider-Man 2099 became trapped in the mainstream Marvel Universe in ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]''. In 2014 he would star in an ongoing series and become involved in the \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" storyline, along with numerous other alternate reality Spider-Men. Notably the Spider-Men 2099s of the \"Exiles\" and \"Timestorm\" series are killed during this event. At the end of this storyline, the 2099 timeline has been altered.\n\nThe 2099 universe is involved in the 2015 storyline \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\".\n\nIn 2016, an issue of ''[[Deadpool]]'' debuted the 2099 version of Deadpool.<ref>Gerding, Stephen (October 20, 2015).

[[CBR.com]].</ref>\n\nIn 2019,  in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #25, [[Dr. Connors]] is giving a lecture on the negligence of the world and environment due to focus on the countless occurrences of superhero activity will end up negatively impacting the future, to the point of catastrophe. Meanwhile, set to his lecture, strange weather phenomenon is occurring above a burning oil rig. A rift opens in the sky and a figure falls out of it, landing on the dock of the rig. The workers un-bury the figure, revealing an unconscious Spider-Man 2099. There was later a series of one-shots to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Marvel 2099. It incorporated the ongoing storyline from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' that not only reintroduced [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Fantastic Four 2099]], [[Doom 2099]], [[Punisher 2099]], and [[Venom 2099]] in individual one-shot issues, but also introduced '''Conan 2099'''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/the-future-is-now-see-the-2099-variants-coming-to-marvel-comics-this-november|title = The Future is Now: See the 2099 Variants Coming to Marvel Comics This November}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe world of 2099 is a [[cyberpunk]] [[dystopia]] (similar to the world of ''[[Blade Runner]]''). [[North America]] is a [[megacorporation|corporate police state]] ruled by a few huge megacorporations, most notably [[Alchemax]], which owns the private police force the Public Eye (which primarily punishes criminals' bank accounts). There were, prior to the launch of the comics, no active superheroes in this world, and the previous heroes are mythologized through religion, as with the Church of Thor. The present-day Marvel continuity is referred to as an \"Age of Heroes\" that abruptly ended in a catastrophe a century before that also set back society (this catastrophe was averted in the present when Miguel O'Hara- [[Spider-Man 2099]]- temporarily swapped places with his past self shortly before the cataclysm, turning Miguel's world into an alternate future of the Marvel Universe rather than ''the'' future).\n\n===Card system===\nIn the 2099 Universe, the monetary currency system uses implants commonly known as cards, which are credit ID implants. There are aluminum cards, gold cards, and platinum cards. Another type of card are black cards, which give the owner unlimited funds and law immunity.<!-- There is also a status known as ''\"decred,\"'' which denies access to many public places, such as hospitals, hypermarkets, and shopping malls.-->\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Heroes===\n\n====Protagonists====\n* [[Doom 2099|Doom]] (Victor Von Doom)\n* [[Ghost Rider 2099|Ghost Rider]] (Kenshiro Cochrane)\n* [[Hulk 2099|Hulk]] (John Eisenhart)\n* [[Punisher 2099|Punisher]] (Jake Gallows)\n* [[Ravage 2099|Ravage]] (Paul-Phillip Ravage)\n* [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] (Miguel O'Hara)\n\n====X-Men 2099====\n* [[Bloodhawk]] (Lemuel Krugg)\n* [[Cerebra]] (Shakti Haddad)\n* Junkpile\n* [[Krystalin]] (Krystalin Porter Ogada)\n* [[La Lunatica]]\n* [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] (Henri Huang)\n* [[Metalhead (comics)|Metalhead]] (Eddie Van Beethoven-Osako)\n* [[Serpentina (comics)|Serpentina]] (Kimberly Potters)\n* [[Skullfire]] (Timothy Sean Michael Fitzgerald)\n* [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan]]\n\n====X-Nation 2099====\n* [[Cerebra]] (Shakti Haddad)\n* Clarion (Hayes Isaacs)\n* [[December (comics)|December]] (December Frost)\n* Metalsmith\n* Nostromo\n* [[Twilight (Marvel Comics)|Twilight]]\n* [[Uproar (comics)|Uproar]]\n* [[Willow (comics)|Willow]]\n* [[Wulff (comics)|Wulff]]\n\n====Fantastic Four 2099====\n* [[Human Torch]] (double of Johnny Storm)\n* [[Invisible Woman]] (double of Sue Storm)\n* [[Mister Fantastic]] (double of Reed Richards)\n* [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (double of Ben Grimm)\n\n====Other heroes====\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* Matt Axel (the Punisher's armorer)\n* Barrio Man\n* [[Captain America]] (imposter posing as Steve Rogers)<ref>Kaminski, Len (w), [[Wood, Ashley]] (p), Daly, Jim (i). \"Chthonic Park\", \"Hell on Earth\", ''[[Ghost Rider 2099]]'' #18-19 (October\u2013November 1995).

After Tony escapes, Andros is forced to ally himself with [[Justin Hammer]], who is known as a hero in 2099, while Hammer manipulates him into attacking the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Helicarrier to preserve his successful future. Andros fights Iron Man, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and S.H.I.E.L.D. until he kills Tony, though not without being infected by a virus Tony created to shut down his advanced armor. Realizing that this virus would evolve into Vortex and that he was the one who doomed the world, Andros his suit's leftover power to go back in time and stop himself from killing Tony, successfully changing the future at the cost of his existence.\n* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode \"The Spider-Verse: Part 1\", the Marvel 2099 universe appears as the first of six parallel universes that Spider-Man ends up in while pursuing the Green Goblin. This version of 2099 has an incarnation of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who rants about Spider-Man 2099. While hunting down the Green Goblin, Spider-Man encounters Spider-Man 2099, who is considering giving up his superhero career as his enemies always come back. After a brief brawl, the two are attacked by the Green Goblin, who gets Spider-Man 2099's DNA, attempts to demolish a nearby tower, and flees to another parallel universe.
