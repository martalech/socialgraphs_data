He had stalked her relatives, the Reilly's, for some time in an attempt to find [[Ben Reilly]], who he claimed burned down his house and killed his family. He found Peter Parker, whom Ben was cloned from, and attacked him, believing him to be Ben. Peter was able to fend off Raptor's attack long enough to sneak off and change into his Spider-Man costume. The two battled, and Raptor was eventually defeated. However, he managed to escape while Peter was distracted at the shock of learning about Ryder's interest in Ben Reilly.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #36</ref>\n\nRyder later tracked Peter down to New York, first attacking him at the Front Line office, then going to his apartment with the intent of leaving a message for Peter with his roommate, Michelle Gonzalez. He then went to May's house, where Peter's cousins and [[Harry Osborn]] were staying, and took all the occupants hostage. When Peter arrived, Raptor threatened to kill them all unless Peter revealed his \"true\" identity.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nThrough flashbacks, it was shown that Ben Reilly once worked as lab assistant to Ryder. The two became close friends during their work searching for proof of dinosaurs being human ancestors, with Ben meeting Ryder's wife and children. However, Ben soon discovered that Ryder had experimented on himself with [[Dromaeosauridae|raptor]] genes in an attempt to further their research. When he confronted him, Ryder grew angry and the two argued. Damon attacked Ben, but Ben managed to restrain him, hoping to bring in a geneticist to purge his system of the mutation. Damon managed to escape in the interim, and Ben followed him to his home, where Damon revealed that he was starting to mutate, thus become more susceptible to Ben's assistance. As they talked, both were unaware that Ben's fellow clone, [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]], was hiding just outside the house. Kaine jumped in through a window and attacked Ben, with a fire starting during the ensuing battle. It was then shown that Damon had murdered his own family, though he did not realize it, having been driven insane by his mutation, his warped mind causing him to conclude that Ben had killed his family in 'protest' against his experiments. Furious, Ben beat him unconscious, with Kaine commenting that the events that unfolded would have drastic consequences.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn the present, Kaine broke into the Parker house, revealing that he was working with Raptor, under the promise of being cured of his cellular degeneration. During the fight, he exposed Peter's identity as Spider-Man, and Ben's identity as a clone. He encouraged Raptor to kill Peter, since anything Ben would do, so would Peter. Refusing to accept this, Peter affirmed both his and Reilly's innocence, proclaiming that neither of them would ever kill anyone, and beat Raptor unconscious, just as Ben had. However, Kaine managed to take Raptor and escape before the police arrived. Raptor later told Kaine that he lied about curing him in order to gain an ally. Enraged, Kaine then breaks Raptor's neck, seemingly killing him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #608\u2013610 (October\u2013November 2009)</ref>\n\n==Mikhail Rasputin==\n{{main|Mikhail Rasputin}}\n\n==Mister Rasputin==\n{{main|Mister Rasputin}}\n\n==Rattler==\n\n===Gustav Krueger===\n{{main|Rattler (comics)}}\n\n===Heath Benson===\n{{main|Rattler (Heath Benson)}}\n\n===Whirlo===\n{{main|Rattler (Whirlo)}}\n\n===Henry Bingham===\n{{main|Rattler (Henry Bingham)}}\n\n==Ravage==\n{{main|Ravage (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n==Ravage 2099==\n{{main|Ravage 2099}}\n\n==Ravonna==\n{{main|Ravonna}}\n\n==Rawhide Kid==\n{{main|Rawhide Kid}}\n\n==Raza==\n'''Raza''' is a fictional character who originated in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] before appearing in [[Marvel Comics]].

He eventually contacted his benefactor, [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], who actually wanted Raza to kill Stark; Raza was unaware of who he was hired to kidnap and wanted Stark's weapons for himself. He planned on giving Stark's designs to Stane in exchange for \"a gift of iron soldiers\". Stane ends up betraying Raza and has all his men killed.

After his father died, Angmo II ascended to the throne and took the name \"Red King\".\n\nAngmo as the new king was vastly different to his warrior-like father; he was vain and childlike, desired power and glory, and had no morals on how to achieve them. Before he died, Angmo's father had recognized these traits in his son and decided that Angmo II posed a threat to the planet and its people if he ever took the throne. The king sent his warbound Shadow, [[Hiroim|Hiroim the Shamed]], to assassinate the prince. The only thing that saved the prince's life was Hiroim's unwillingness to kill a child.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #98</ref>\n\nWhile Angmo was still young he came across the thirteen year old [[Caiera]] whose village was attacked by the Spikes. Using her Old Power and fighting skills she fought the infected of her village until she was saved by the young Red King. The Red King had stood by and allowed her village to be infected in order to find a Shadow with the Old Power. He proceeded to enslave her. She was later freed and officially made the King's bodyguard.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Skaar: Son of Hulk Presents \u2013 Savage World of Sakaar #1''</ref> The Red King would go on to have almost all his sons and daughters slaughtered to ensure they could not take the throne from him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Red King still ruled Sakaar when the Hulk was inadvertently exiled to their world. Initially the Hulk was enslaved and trained as a gladiator to fight for the entertainment of the Emperor but he quickly began to gain attention as the Green Scar and Sakaarson, a mythical figure prophesied to rule Sakaar and heal it.\n\nThe Red King grew concerned and tried to have the Hulk killed repeatedly to no avail until they entered into open war with one another. The Hulk led his friends the [[Warbound]] and others against the Red King, eventually gaining the support of the King's own bodyguard, Caiera the Oldstrong, who turned against him when the Red King unleashed the Spikes against the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #92\u201399</ref>\n\nThe Hulk led his forces on Crown City and personally fought the Red King, seemingly defeating him and stopping the destruction of Crown City caused by the King. At some point after his downfall, the Red King was found by the Wildebots and reconstructed as a Cyborg, leading survivors of Crown City to safety and coming to regret his past actions, feeling that the Hulk had helped him become who he should have been. The Red King followed the Hulk's son [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] up until the destruction of the planet. It remains unclear whether or not he survived the planet being consumed by [[Galactus]].\n\n===Red King in other media===\n* The Red King appears in the ''[[Planet Hulk (film)|Planet Hulk]]'' film adaptation, voiced by [[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]]. Unlike the comics, Caiera infects the King with spikes as revenge before leaving him to be slaughtered by his [[Death's Head]] guards.\n* The Red King appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode \"Planet Hulk!

He was a veteran who had served 4 years in the U.S. Army with his friend, [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]]. Both became disillusioned and grew bored due to the lack of action during peace-time service. They both signed up for the [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]]'s strength augmentation process, and joined the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation. Later, John Walker approached him to form a team of superhumans, known as the B.U.C.s (Bold Urban Commandos) or \"Buckies\". This team consisted of Johnson, [[Battlestar (comics)|Lemar Hoskins]], and [[Left-Winger (comics)|Hector Lennox]], and they all wore variations of [[Captain America]]'s costume.\n\nWalker, now known as the Super-Patriot publicly spoke out against the original Captain America, and the Buckies pretended to be Cap's supporters. The Buckies staged opposition to Walker and pretended to attack him at a rally in [[Central Park]] as a publicity stunt. Walker defeated these protesters and proclaimed to Captain America that the people should decide who was worthy of being Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #323</ref> Eventually, the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] selected Walker to replace Steve Rogers as Captain America, and chose Lemar Hoskins to become his partner Bucky (and later as Battlestar).\n\nLennox and Johnson were left behind, feeling betrayed and angered. They chose the names Left-Winger and Right-Winger respectively. They wore stolen [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] armor and battled Walker and Hoskins.<ref name=\"Captain America #334\">''Captain America'' #334</ref> The pair upstaged the new Captain America at a patriotic rally and press conference, attacking him and revealing Walker's identity to the press out of jealousy over his new-found success.<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref> As a result, Walker's parents were killed by the militia group [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|The Watchdogs]], nearly driving Walker into a mental breakdown. Walker blamed his former partners for his parents' deaths, and he stalked them. When he caught up to Left-Winger and Right-Winger, he tied them to an oil tank which was detonated by a torch-saber and left them to die.<ref>''Captain America'' #347</ref> They barely survived the explosion due to their bodies' enhanced physiology, leaving them terribly burned and in critical condition.\n\nLater, Walker became the [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] and joined the [[West Coast Avengers]]. Left-Winger and Right-Winger, alongside several others, were plucked from different time periods by [[Immortus]] to serve in the third [[Legion of the Unliving]]. They battled U.S. Agent, who slew them again not believing them to be authentic.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #61</ref>\n\nEventually, it was revealed to Walker that the pair had survived the explosion and were hospitalized in Houston. After undergoing painful treatment for the burns they received, they had committed suicide.
