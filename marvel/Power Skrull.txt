He is a foe of the [[Fantastic Four]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand-section|date=March 2014}}\nPaibok's first appearance was in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #358 (November 1991); he was created by [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Paul Ryan (cartoonist)|Paul Ryan]] and Danny Bulanadi.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nPaibok was born on the planet Tarnax IV, in the Tarnax System in the Andromeda Galaxy. His home planet was part of the Skrull Empire, but has since been destroyed. Paibok was trained at the Skrullian military academy, and became a Skrull espionage agent, and a captain in the Skrull armed forces.\n\n===Lyja and Alicia===\nThe Skrull Empire seeks a way to defeat the [[Fantastic Four]], who have handed them multiple defeats. Paibok suggests a subtle plan: replacing the Fantastic Four's associate [[Alicia Masters]] with [[Lyja]], a Skrull spy and Paibok's former lover. Their relationship had not ended well.\n\nLyja successfully impersonates Alicia and the real Alicia is held prisoner by Paibok.\n\nEventually the Fantastic Four realize what had happened and come in search of Alicia. They confront Paibok on 'War World'. Paibok, now calling himself the \"Power Skrull\" after being augmented in a manner similar to the [[Super-Skrull]], is prepared for the encounter and almost defeats the Fantastic Four and Lyja.\n\nLyja seemingly sacrifices her life to protect the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] finally defeats Paibok. He is left for dead, buried under fallen rubble.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #358 (November 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Fearsome Foursome===\nPaibok survived the battle and recovered Lyja's body. Seeking revenge on the Fantastic Four, he encountered [[Devos the Devastator]], another alien who had clashed with them, and the two formed an alliance.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #366. Marvel Comics.</ref> Devos was able to revive Lyja, and Paibok and Devos altered Lyja's genetic structure, granting her the power of flight and the ability to project lethal energy blasts. Together, the three traveled to earth to battle the Fantastic Four again.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nArriving on earth, they isolated and attacked the Human Torch in New York City, forcing him to use his ''Nova Flame'' against them \u2014 a move which then led to his arrest for damage to the surroundings. A second attack confused and aggravated the situation, leaving the Human Torch a fugitive from the police.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #369-372. Marvel Comics.</ref> Alongside Devos and Lyja, Paibok witnessed the battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. Paibok was betrayed by Lyja when she again joined the conflict and abandoned Paibok and sided with the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #374. Marvel Comics.</ref> Alongside Devos, Paibok attacked the Human Torch during his trial.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #377. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUndeterred, Paibok and Devos recruited new allies \u2014 [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and [[Huntara]] \u2014 and the quartet continued their attacks on the Fantastic Four, becoming known as the [[Fearsome Foursome (comics)|Fearsome Foursome]]. Eventually they were able to capture their foes (including Lyja) and returned to the Skrull Throneworld to present the captives to the Empress.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nPaibok's triumph was short-lived, though \u2014 once on Throneworld he discovered that Devos was a wanted criminal, a renegade with a price on his head and an entire world under his command. Devos promptly summoned his troops, took personal command of his flagship (the ''Death Cruiser'') and attempted to destroy Throneworld. The Empress blamed Paibok for this and repaid him by ordering his death.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nSeeking to redeem himself, Paibok made his way on board the ''Death Cruiser'' and confronted Devos. The ship's stardrive was damaged during their confrontation and the cruiser fell into subspace \u2014 Devos and Paibok were both believed lost along with the ship.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Freakshow===\nPaibok somehow escaped from subspace and struck a deal with [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Centaurians|Centaurian]] scientists to enhance his powers. Their treatment succeeded \u2014 but also affected his appearance, leaving him in a cadaverous, zombie-like form. Still viewed as a traitor, he fled to Earth and assembled a band of Skrull renegades.<ref>''Thing: Freakshow'' #3 (October 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDisguised as ''Paul Balk'', the owner of a traveling freakshow, Paibok located and tried to capture an immature [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], a plan that led to clashes with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and a band of [[Kree]].<ref>''Thing: Freakshow'' #1 (August 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref> The attempt failed and he was captured by the Kree, who left Earth shortly afterwards with Paibok as their prisoner.<ref>''Thing: Freakshow'' #4 (November 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Earthfall===\nIt is not known how Paibok was transferred out of Kree custody, but he was next seen as one of the few convicts to survive when the prison transport vessel ''Dredge 01'' crashed on its way to [[Kyln]].<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #1 (September 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Paibok's appearance had, without explanation, been reverted to that of a typical Skrull. The prison ship crashed on Earth, near the town of Coot's Bluff in Alaska, and Paibok immediately took command of the other survivors ([[Lunatik]] and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]]) in an attempt to salvage the wrecked ship's technology and escape the planet. Paibok's plan also involved taking control of Coot's Bluff and using the terrified population as slave labor \u2014 something which brought his renegades into conflict with the only other survivor of the crash, [[Drax the Destroyer]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nInitially, Paibok and his allies defeated Drax, leaving him for dead. However, Drax somehow recovered \u2014 and then hunted down his attackers, killing Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers. Paibok's escape plan was abandoned and, faced with death at the hands of a vengeful Drax, he activated a distress beacon that he had secretly salvaged from the wreck \u2014 summoning another ship and surrendering himself to the authorities who had previously imprisoned him.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #4 (January 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Annihilation===\n{{see also|Annihilation (comics)}}\nPaibok later reappears fighting for [[Annihilus]] and his allies, as part of the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]].<ref>''Annihilation'' #1 (October 2006).</ref> Following the death of Annihilus, the parasites injected into Paibok to force his obedience cease functioning. He briefly joins forces with [[Terrax|Terrax the Tamer]] and the [[Infant Terrible|Delinquent]] to kill [[Randau the Space Parasite]], a being that had been slaughtering innocents. After the battle, which ends with the destruction of the planet by Terrax, he convinces the addled Delinquent to craft a spaceship. They return to what remains of the Skrull Empire.<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1 (April 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===All-New, All-Different Marvel===\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Paibok appears as a member of the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]]'s [[Revengers|New Revengers]].<ref>''New Avengers vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a [[Skrull]], Paibok possesses a heightened degree of physical malleability, an innate racial ability to shapeshift and the power of hypnosis. \n\nHe is a graduate of the Skrullian military academy and is an expert in all forms of armed and unarmed combat known to the Skrulls. Paibok also has knowledge of and access to technology centuries ahead of conventional Earth science. Paibok wears body armor of unspecified materials.\n\nPaibok also has a set of additional powers thanks to biogenetic engineering by Skrull scientists. He possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and durability, the power of flight, and the abilities to transform his skin into a durable steel-like substance, project blasts of bio-electricity up to 50,000 volts, and to project bursts of cold to [[absolute zero]] from his hands and to freeze local moisture from the air, thus forming ice constructs. He possesses an immunity to the effects of his own electrostatic and cold temperature powers.\n\n==In other media==\nPaibok appears as a mini-boss in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]]. He appears during a mission when the player must visit the Skrull homeworld that is under attack by [[Galactus]]. Initially, the player can choose either the [[Super-Skrull]] or Paibok to act as bodyguards while opening the doors for the Skrull Empress' spaceship to escape. The only exception is if your team is composed of the [[Fantastic Four]] in which case they do not trust either Paibok or the Super-Skrull. Afterwards, the Skrull Empress then orders Paibok and the Super-Skrull to kill the heroes while she escapes. A simulation disk has the Human Torch fighting Paibok and a VS simulation disk has the heroes fighting Paibok.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Paibok Paibok] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/paibokskrull.htm|Paibok the Power-Skrull}}\n\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics military personnel]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Skrull]]"}}}]}}}}
