Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], Iron Fist first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15 (May 1974). The character is a practitioner of [[martial arts]] and the wielder of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist, which allows him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]''. This ability is obtained from the city of [[Kunlun (mythology)|K'un-Lun]] which appears on earth every 10 years.\n\nHe starred in his own solo series in the 1970s, and shared the title ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' for several years with [[Luke Cage]], partnering with Cage to form the superhero team [[Heroes for Hire]]. Rand frequently appeared with the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] duo [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]] \u2013 with Rand often seen in a relationship with the former, marking the first interracial romance in Marvel Comics history. The character has starred in numerous solo titles since, including ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', which expanded on his origin story and the history of the Iron Fist.\n\nIron Fist has been adapted to appear in several animated television series and video games. [[Finn Jones]] portrayed [[Danny Rand (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]] in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[Netflix]] [[Netflix's Marvel television series|television series]] ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' (2016\u20132018), ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' (2017), and the [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]''.\n\n==Development==\n[[Image:Amazing-Man Comics 5 page 05.jpg|thumb|[[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Amazing-Man]] in ''Amazing-Man Comics'' #5 (September 1939). Art by Bill Everett]]\nIron Fist, along with the previously created [[Shang-Chi]], Master of Kung Fu, came from [[Marvel Comics]] during an American [[popular culture|pop culture]] trend in the early to mid-1970s of [[martial arts]] heroes. Writer/co-creator [[Roy Thomas]] wrote in a text piece in ''Marvel Premiere'' #15 that Iron Fist's origin and creation owe much to the [[Bill Everett]] character, [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman, the Amazing-Man]], created in 1939. Thomas later wrote that he and artist/co-creator [[Gil Kane]] had\n\n{{blockquote|...started \"Iron Fist\" because I'd seen my first [[kung fu]] movie, even before a [[Bruce Lee]] one came out, and it had a thing called \"the ceremony of the Iron Fist\" in it. I thought that was a good name, and we already had ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' going, but I thought, \"Maybe a superhero called Iron Fist, even though we had [[Iron Man]], would be a good idea.\" [Publisher] Stan [Lee] liked the name, so I got hold of Gil and he brought in his Amazing Man influences, and we designed the character together...<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | issue=70 | date=July 2007| title=Roy Thomas interview | page=38}}</ref>}}\n\nThe film mentioned by Thomas is ''[[King Boxer]]'', aka ''Five Fingers of Death'' (1972), which presents the ''Iron Fist'' technique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vocal.media/geeks/two-fisted-tales-the-untold-origin-of-the-comic-book-superhero-iron-fist|title=Two-Fisted Tales: The Untold Origin of the Comic Book Superhero Iron Fist|website=Geeks|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>\n\nThomas further discussed the characters creation stating, \"When Stan Lee gave me a verbal approval to star him in a series, I contacted Gil Kane and we worked out the costume and story.  I had Gil give him a dragon brand on his chest, inspired by the one branded into Bullseye, a great western character created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]].  At Gil's urging, we took some story elements from [[Bill Everett]]'s 1939 hero Amazing-Man, which itself had borrowed heavily from [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s novel [[Lost Horizon]] and the first movie made from it, which introduced \"[[Shangri-La]]\" to the world.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-roy-thomas-marvel-comics-characters_1.html | title=\"Hero Envy\" the Blog Adventures: THE ROY THOMAS MARVEL COMICS CHARACTERS, CONCEPTS AND CREATIONS PART 1 | date=January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nDebuting in a story written by Thomas and [[pencilled]] by Kane in the umbrella title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15\u201325 (May 1974 \u2013 October 1975), he was then written successively by [[Len Wein]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Tony Isabella]], and [[Chris Claremont]], with art by successive pencillers [[Larry Hama]], [[Arvell Jones]], [[Pat Broderick]], and, in some of his earliest professional work, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. As the ''Marvel Premiere'' issues had successfully established a considerable readership for the character,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=25 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> following this run, Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series ''Iron Fist'', which ran 15 issues (November 1975 \u2013 September 1977). The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne. A subplot involving the [[Steel Serpent]] left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues #63\u201364 of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', the latter of which featured Rand kiss [[Misty Knight]], marking the first interracial kiss and first long-term interracial couple in [[Marvel Comics]] history, as well as the first couple with an age difference in which the woman was older than her man.{{cn|date=August 2022}}\n\nTo rescue the character from cancellation, Marvel paired Iron Fist with another character who was no longer popular enough to sustain his own series, [[Luke Cage]].<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Timothy |date=December 2010 |title=Power Man and Iron Fist |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=45 |pages= 3\u201311 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The two characters were partnered in a three-part story in Cage's series ''Power Man'' #48\u201350. The title of the series changed to ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' with issue #50 (April 1978), although the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] did not reflect this change until issue #67. Iron Fist co-starred in the series until the final issue (#125, September 1986). Writer Jim Owsley (subsequently known as [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]) later commented, \"Fist's death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers' heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist's death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book.\"<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nIron Fist was revived half a decade later in ''[[Namor]], the Sub-Mariner'' #21\u201325 (December 1991 \u2013 April 1992), a story which revealed that the character killed in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125 was a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]. The story was both written and drawn by Byrne, who found the manner of Iron Fist's death objectionable and later commented, \"In one of those amazing examples of Marvel serendipity, it turned out to be fairly easy not only to resurrect Danny, but to make it seem like that was the plan all along.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=91|pages=57\u201358 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Iron Fist then became a frequently starring character in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', featuring in three multi-part [[story arc]]s and four one-shot stories in 1992 and 1993.

Also around this time, he was among the ensemble of the group series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' which ran 19 issues (July 1997 \u2013 January 1999).\n\nFollowing a four-issue miniseries by writer [[Jay Faerber]] and penciller [[Jamal Igle]], ''Iron Fist: Wolverine'' (November 2000 \u2013 February 2001), co-starring the [[X-Men]] character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and cover-billed as ''Iron Fist/Wolverine: The Return of K'un-Lun'', came another solo miniseries, ''Iron Fist'' vol. 4 #1\u20136 (May\u2013October 2004), by writer [[Jim Mullaney]] and penciller Kevin Lau. Subsequently, a new Iron Fist series premiered called ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]''.

His father, [[Wendell Rand]], as a young boy happened upon the mystical city of [[K'un-L'un]]. During his time in K'un-L'un, Wendell saved the life of the city's ruler, Lord Tuan, and was adopted as Tuan's son. However, Wendell eventually left K'un-L'un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States. He married socialite [[Heather Rand|Heather Duncan]] and had a child, Daniel. Wendell later organizes an expedition to again seek out K'un-L'un, taking his wife Heather, his business partner [[Harold Meachum]] and nine-year-old Danny. During the journey up the mountain, Danny slips off the path, his tie-rope taking his mother and father with him. Meachum, who also loves Heather, forces Wendell to plunge to his death but offers to rescue Heather and Danny. She rejects his help. Heather and Danny come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves. Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Danny and is killed even as archers from K'un-L'un attempt to save her. The archers take the grieving Danny to see [[Yu-Ti]], the hooded ruler of K'un-L'un. When Danny expresses his desire for vengeance, Y\u00fc-Ti apprentices him to [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]] the Thunderer, who teaches him martial arts. Danny proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung's students. He toughens his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock. At 19, Danny is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] [[Shou-Lao]] the Undying, who guards the molten heart that had been torn from its body. Guessing that the heart provides life energy to Shou-Lao through the dragon-shaped scar on its chest, Danny covers the scar with his own body and hangs on until Shou-Lao collapses and dies, in the process burning a dragon brand into his own chest. Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing the creature's molten heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Danny is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists. When K'un-L'un reappears on Earth after 10 years, Danny leaves to find his father's killer. Returning to New York, Danny Rand, dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist, seeks out Harold Meachum, now head of Meachum Industries. After overcoming a number of attempts on his life, he confronts Meachum in his office, only to find the man legless&mdash;an amputation carried out when, after abandoning Danny and his mother, he was caught in heavy snow and his legs became frostbitten. Meachum accepts his fate and tells Iron Fist to kill him. Overcome with pity, Iron Fist walks away. At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja, and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #15\u201318.

When Bushmaster discovers Knight's treachery, he kidnaps [[Claire Temple]] and Noah Burstein, close associates of [[Luke Cage]], better known as Power Man, and holds them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight. Iron Fist is on hand to stop him, however, and after a battle, the truth comes out. Rand helps Cage and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] (Knight and Wing) battle Bushmaster, rescue Temple and Burstein, and obtain evidence that proves Cage's innocence of prior drug charges. Afterwards, Iron Fist and Power Man become partners, forming [[Heroes for Hire]], Inc.<ref>''Power Man'' #48\u201350.

The H'ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra-dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key. To this end, she takes the identity of Death Sting, bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] When the H'ylthri try to kill Iron Fist, Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them, seemingly killing herself in the process.
