She first appeared in McFarlane's creator-owned series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993, and later starring in her own self-titled miniseries. She is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn.\n\nAngela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. Gaiman later sold the rights to the character to [[Marvel Comics]]; she was integrated into the [[Marvel Universe]] in the 2013 story \"[[Age of Ultron]]\",<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=19}}</ref> and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 storyline \"[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\", where she was established to be '''Aldrif Odinsdottir''', the lost sister of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].\n\n==Publication history==\n===Image Comics===\nIn 1993 [[Todd McFarlane]] contracted [[Neil Gaiman]], along with three other recognized authors, [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Sim]], and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], to write one issue of his creator-owned comics series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', which was published by [[Image Comics]]. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, [[Cogliostro]], and [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were co-created and designed by McFarlane. Angela first appeared in issue #9, as an adversary. In 1994 and 1995, a three-issue ''Angela'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] was published, written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Greg Capullo]], in which Angela and Spawn were forced by circumstance to temporarily work together as allies. The series was later reprinted as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] titled ''Angela Trade Paperback'', retitled as ''Spawn: Angela's Hunt'' in later printings and given a new cover design ({{ISBN|1-887279-09-1}}).\n\nThe monthly ''Spawn'' series continued to feature all of the characters Gaiman had created long after his direct involvement had ended. Some characters had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company, and Cogliostro had a prominent role in the live-action movie in 1997, Angela would appear in ''Spawn'' #62, #89, and #96 through #100, and in a 1995, a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]]. She was also featured in several [[fictional crossover|crossovers]]. The ''Rage of Angels'' miniseries saw Angela meeting [[Glory (comics)|Glory]] in ''Angela and Glory'' (1996), and was continued in ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' #6 (1996) and ''[[Team Youngblood]]'' #21. There was also a crossover called ''Aria/Angela'', in which she featured in the series ''[[Aria (comics)|Aria]]''.\n\nMcFarlane had agreed that Gaiman retained creator rights to the characters, but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's co-creations entirely, pointing to the legal indicia of ''Spawn'' #9 and the lack of legal contract stating otherwise. McFarlane had also refused to pay Gaiman for the volumes of Gaiman's work that McFarlane republished and kept in print. In 2002, Gaiman filed suit and won a sizable judgment against McFarlane and Image Comics for the rights due any creator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/spawn-comic-book-todd-mcfarlane-neil-gaiman-286071/|title=Decades-Long Legal Feud over 'Spawn' Comic Book Finally Ends|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/gaiman-v-mcfarlane-2|title = Gaiman v.

A long time ago, the Angel tasked to dispose of Aldrif's body found out the baby was alive and raised her as one of the Angels under the name of Angela. In light of this revelation, the Queen of Angels grants Angela her life, pardoning her for her service to the Angels, but exiles her from Heven due to her lineage. After leaving Heven, Odin tells Thor, Loki, and Angela that he still loves his children. Angela then decides to leave in order to explore the other realms.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.5.

There, Angela throws the baby into the stalled engines of Heven. Surtur's fire is expelled from the baby and reignites the engines of Heven.
