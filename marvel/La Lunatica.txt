It extends the [[Marvel 2099]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], which features other future versions of popular [[List of Marvel Comics characters|Marvel characters]], such as [[Spider-Man 2099]] and [[Hulk 2099]]. The series was written by [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] and largely pencilled by [[Ron Lim]].\n\nThe series began in October 1993 and lasted 35 issues along with two specials. It spawned a line of [[action figure]]s, mostly featuring the more popular characters in the book. In issue #20, the title received a minor makeover, officially joining the [[Marvel 2099|2099 imprint]] and changing its name to ''X-Men 2099 A.D.'', the \"A.D.\" standing for \"After [[Doom 2099|Doom]]\". At the series' end, it was folded into ''[[2099: World of Tomorrow]]'', though members of the team were rarely seen after that point.\n\nThe first issue featured a blue foil cover on cardstock and the double-sized 25th issue's cover was extra-glossy with foil letters, metallic silver ink, and embossed characters on a heavier wraparound cover.\n\nIn June 2009, a mini-series called ''[[Timestorm 2009\u20132099]]'' brought back Spider-Man, [[Ghost Rider 2099|Ghost Rider]], the X-Men, and more from the 2099 universe in a very different version.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19763 | title=Exclusive: Timestorm 2009/2099 Designs | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the original version returned in the Spider-Man 2099 arc \"Civil War 2099\" (also appearing in X-Men '92 series).\nLater the team appeared again in X-Men Blue, helping the original time displaced X-Men.\n\n==Main Characters==\nThe team featured an ever-changing line-up, but the mainstays included:\n\n* '''[[Xi'an (comics)|Desert Ghost]]''' (Xi'an Chi Xan) \u2013 Founder.
