However, Thor did form a willing romance with Amora during a vulnerable state when Odin abandoned him without his powers on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #491-494</ref> This relationship reached its pinnacle when Thor assumed the throne of Asgard and took the Enchantress as his bride. Amora helped Thor create a dark future in which they ruled Asgard and Earth with an iron fist and even had a child, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]]. However, this was all undone when Thor traveled back in time to prevent this future from occurring.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #68-79</ref>\n*'''[[Shawna Lynde]]''', a fellow doctor of Donald Blake's.

Loki hoped Lorelei could then use her influence over Thor to gain his support for Loki's bid for the throne of Asgard. However, the Enchantress jealously cast a spell of her own, which caused Lorelei to fall in love with Loki. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] in turn used this to expose Thor to their plot.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #357-359</ref>\n*'''[[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde]]''' the [[valkyrie]] attempted (to no avail) to save the life of Thor, who was incarnated as [[Sigmund]] against Odin's wishes. Brunnhilde ''was'', however, able to keep Sigmund's pregnant wife, Sieglinde, from harm. As punishment, Odin removed Brunnhilde's powers and cast her into a deep sleep. Brunnhilde is eventually awakened by Thor, who reincarnated as [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], the son of Sigmund and Sieglinde. Brunnhilde and Siegfried become lovers, but Siegfried, under the influence of magic, betrays her. When Siegfried is killed, Brunnhilde, who is still in love with him, jumps into his blazing funeral pyre.
