Their race is largely insensitive and they view all other species as a threat. They even distrust each other and often get in their own way.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe Deviants first appeared in ''The Eternals'' #1 (July 1976).\n\n==Fictional history==\nThey are an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth instigated by the alien [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and wage war against their counterparts, the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].\n\nWhile the Eternals possess godlike power and are generally physically beautiful, the Deviants (who sometimes refer to themselves as 'the changing people') are for the most part hideous, with each member of their race possessing some random physical and/or cosmetic [[mutation]] that is by Celestial design never repeated within the sub-species. Extremely mutated or deformed Deviants are referred to as \"mutates\" and some of the monsters of myth and legend have in fact been identified as Deviant mutates. Some of these mutations can provide [[superhuman]] abilities, but their powers are usually not as great as those of the Eternals.\n\nAccording to the account of one Deviant in the 2006 comic book mini-series,<ref name=\"Eternals' 2006\">''Eternals'' vol. 3 #5 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> the Deviants were created as a delicacy to be consumed ''en masse'' by Celestials at periodic intervals once they multiplied sufficiently. The veracity of this has been revealed untrue as the Deviants and the Eternals were actually created because the Celestials saw the human population as a useful pathogen to act as antibodies against the Horde, so the Deviants and the Eternals were to defend the process under the false impression that they were actually protecting the human race.\n\nThe Deviants are religious, revering the [[Dreaming Celestial]] (\"He Who Sleeps in Darkness\"). They credit him with their creation and claim that he granted them dominion over the Earth, an agreement they believe was later broken by the treachery of the other Celestials. They have one or more holy books\u2014the only one named thus far being the ''Book of Krask''.\n\nThe Deviants had already developed advanced technology such as [[genetic engineering]] when humans were still living in caves.\n\nAt some point in prehistoric times, some Deviants chased after [[Star Brand#Vnn|Vnn]] and his lover Brrkk. When Brrkk died, Vnn found the corpse of a [[Tyrannosaurus]] that previously possessed the [[Star Brand]]. Vnn absorbed the Star Brand powers and used them to defeat the Deviants.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the advent of the heroic age, Brother Tode was leading the Deviants, with his capital in the city of the Toads in the sunken continent of Lemuria.<ref name=\"Eternals #1\"/> When the Fourth Celestial Host arrived on Earth, Deviants soldiers led by Warlord [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] attacked New York City in an attempt to provoke fear in the humans and trick them into attacking the Celestials.<ref name=\"Eternals #3\"/> When this attempt failed, the Deviants sent an attack team to the Celestial spaceship, which failed too.<ref>''The Eternals'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, the Deviants' aristocracy, led by Brother Tode, attacked Olympia and kidnapped the Eternals with the intent to disintegrate them. However, the hero [[War Machine|Iron Man (James Rhodes)]] rescued the Eternals and helped them in the defeat of the Deviants. The Eternals transformed the Deviants' aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them.<ref>''Iron Man'' Annual #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Only Warlord Kro escaped with the help of his old lover Thena of the Eternals.\n\nWithout the aristocracy, the Deviants' priests seized power, led by Priestlord [[Ghaur]], who killed the son of Tode, Ranar. Kro returned to Lemuria and was crowned as a figurehead monarch, with the real power in the hands of Ghaur.<ref>''The Eternals'' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> With their new leader, the Deviants battled the Eternals again. Ghaur absorbed the power of the Dreaming Celestial and tried to ascend to godhood, but was defeated by the Eternals and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and was disintegrated. Kro was left as king of the Deviants.<ref>''The Eternals'' vol. 2 #10-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nGhaur returned to corporeal form and tried to obtain the Serpent Crown with help of the Atlantean Lemurians, led by [[Llyra]], in an attempt to invoke the Old God Set.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #23.(1989) Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers and Fantastic Four put an end to their mad plan and Ghaur was disintegrated once more.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #22. (1989) Marvel Comics.</ref> Without Ghaur, and with the abdication of Kro, the Deviants' society fall into anarchy and revolution. First, a warlord called Brutus tried to conquer the different races of the subterrain, but was killed when the Deviants discovered his ''mutate'' origin. Later Brother Visara led the Deviants in killing all the ''leaders'' and their followers. He was ultimately killed as well.<ref>''Eternals Herod Factor'' #1 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Kro led a group of  heroic Deviants, the Delta Network to rescue the Avengers from a resurrected Ghaur, who used his powers to control the Deviants once more.<ref>''The Avengers'' #370-371. (1995) Marvel Comics.</ref> Ghaur (in a form of a giant statue) and the Deviants fought the Eternals and the [[Heroes for Hire]], when the mad priest created an ''Anti-Mind'' in his plan to rule the world.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #5-7. (1997) Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nKro and Ghaur formed bickering factions and kept the struggle for power for Deviant Lemuria. The external world did not know who was in charge. Ghaur risked a war with [[Wakanda]] after he discovered that his ''rejected'' (human-like) daughter was alive in that country. The Wakandan forces sieged Lemuria and the tension grew. Finally, the daughter was declared officially dead and Ghaur saved face.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #26-29. (2001) Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #43-45. (2001) Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, the Deviant males were rendered sterile by a plague, the anarchy reigned, and a power contest between [[Ereshkigal (comics)|Ereshkigal]] and Ghaur happened. Ghaur won when he promised the Deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped Eternal [[Phastos]] and the Eternal's resurrection machine. The Asgardian god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. When the Unbiding Stone (a doomsday artifact stolen by Erishkigal) was destroyed, Ghaur and Erishkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.<ref>''Thor: the Deviants Saga'' #1-5 (2012).
