He later made the jump to these with his first appearance in the DC Universe in ''[[Catwoman]]'' (vol. 3) #78 (April 2008), now known as '''Repro'''.\n\nBilly Numerous (real name '''William \"Billy\" Strayer''') is a former student of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy and an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]]. Numerous first appeared as a student of the H.I.V.E Academy, where his power of self-duplication was subtly hinted at. After the H.I.V.E. was destroyed during [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s confrontation with [[Brother Blood]], Numerous and most of the other students went freelance. Later, Numerous engaged in a robbing spree all across Jump City and he stole anything he and his innumerable clones could get his (their) collective hands on. His power thoroughly confounded the Titans, especially Cyborg, who became all the more obsessed in catching him. Finally, however, Cyborg realized that there was another way of catching Numerous. He and the other Titans confronted Numerous in the old stadium where he had stashed his loot, seemingly with numerous copies of themselves. In order to bring them down, Numerous created even more clones of himself, but finally pushed his powers too far. The resulting reabsorption of each of his clones caused a massive physical and mental shock, stunning him and enabling his capture. To add insult to injury, the Titans' copies were not actual clones, but merely holographic projections created and controlled by Cyborg.\n\nAt some point, Numerous entered [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]]'s H.I.V.E. Five and was also recruited into the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. As one of the Five, he participated in the attempted capture of [[Kid Flash]], but even his numerous clones were unable to stop the super-speedster. Later, when the Brotherhood executed its worldwide strike against young superheroes, he and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] were sent to capture Kole and Gnarrk in their subterranean retreat, but both heroes escaped them. When the remnants of the Titans under [[Beast Boy]] later attacked the Brotherhood's headquarters, Numerous and most of his H.I.V.E. Five teammates tried to run, but were intercepted by Kid Flash, aghast to see that Jinx had switched sides and joined up with him. Moments later, they were all swept away by one of Jinx's hexes and carted off by Kid Flash for flash-freeze treatment.\n \nIn ''[[Catwoman]]'' (vol. 3) #78 (April 2008), a character based on Billy Numerous named '''Repro''' appears. The small-time crook known as Repro was operating in [[Gotham City]] during the time when many of the city's criminals disappeared for a short time. He was one of the only two criminals left in the city, with the other being the Thief. Repro was a young and inexperienced criminal who only did small-time criminal activities, just enough to stay off the radar of big-time crime fighters. After a confrontation with Catwoman where he thought he had shot her in the chest, he hastily departed and ran to the Thief to tell him about it. He was, in turn, shot in the chest and killed by the Thief, who then dumped his body in an alley to cover up the murder.\n\n=== Billy Numerous in other media ===\n* Billy Numerous appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' tie-in comics. He appears as a background villain and member of the H.I.V.E. Five in this comic adaptation of the animated television series.

Labs, [[Harrison Wells]]. In pursuit of this goal, Farooq was confronted by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], but drained the hero's speed. He later storms S.T.A.R. Labs, kills [[Girder (comics)|Girder]], and attacks Wells. However, the Flash is able to get his speed back and overcharge him, killing Farooq in the process.\n\n==Blackrock==\n'''Blackrock''' is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Blackrock is a recurring enemy of [[Superman]] first appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #458 (April 1976).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nBlackrock was the creation of '''Dr. Peter Silverstone''' in an attempt to increase ratings for the United Broadcasting [[television network]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> Silverstone hypnotized UB President Sam Tanner and later Tanner's nephew, Les Vegas, to fill the role. A third Blackrock (an energy construct) was created by Tanner's command not much later.\n\nEventually Silverstone assumed the mantle of Blackrock himself, using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight, energy blasts and superhuman strength, and fought Superman several times. This rock, while a technological artifact, has the appearance of a polished [[Gemstone|gem]] that is as black as [[coal]]. It was appropriately dubbed the Blackrock.\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' version was stated (in ''Batman/Superman'' adventures) to be a symbiotic alien life form, rather than a creation of Dr. Silverstone. Its appearance and abilities are approximately the same.\n\nSilverstone is the only Pre-''Crisis'' user of the stone that has been mentioned in Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Overuse of the Blackrock's powers blinded Silverstone and left him insane. He was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex-convict named '''Samuel Benjamin''', who beat Silverstone to death with the Blackrock and took it for himself. Despite its power, his inexperience with the Blackrock led to his defeat and Superman took the stone and threw it towards the Sun.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #218 (August 2005)</ref>\n\nA short time later, [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], disguised as [[Lex Luthor]], dispatched [[Bizarro]] to retrieve the Blackrock from the Sun<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #222 (December 2005)</ref> before passing it on to a South American woman named '''Lucia''',<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #223 (January 2006)</ref> a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by Superman before. Her intense feelings of hatred towards the Man of Steel matched those of the Blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it. However, her skills were not enough to defeat Superman and the Blackrock withdrew into itself.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #224 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nIt was eventually shown that the Blackrock had been kept by Superman, who locked it away in his Fortress of Solitude. The Blackrock escaped and bonded with [[Plastic Man]]. Shortly after, the Blackrock was removed from Plastic Man and found its way into the hands of [[Batman]], who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently-rampaging Superman (Superman had fallen under the influence of [[Despero]] as he attempted to turn Earth's alien superheroes against humans). Although it remained on Batman after Superman threw off Despero's influence, Superman was able to force it to leave Batman by threatening to kill him, informing the Blackrock that he knew Batman would rather die than live like this.\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blackrock is '''Bradley Glenn''', an ex-con who was hired to star in a [[reality television]] show called ''Badass Nation'' about the life of a supervillain.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #5 (April 2016)</ref> The TV company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft. They intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition, but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the Pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' Superman had to intervene.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #6 (May 2016)</ref>\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' wielders of the Blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities. All seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance, flight and energy projection abilities. The Blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder. Dr. Silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from TV and radio signals. Samuel Benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness. Lucia's abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors', but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain Superman's power.\n\nWhile the stone had bonded to [[Plastic Man]], he was not shown using its abilities much.\n\n[[Batman]] used it in much the same way that Lucia did, but Batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than Lucia did.\n\n[[Jimmy Olsen]] and several other humans were bonded to the Blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on Earth. These people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by Lucia, etc. but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was.\n\nBradley Glenn's armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch.\n\n==Blackwing==\n'''Blackwing''' ('''Charles \"Charlie\" Bullock''') is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He was created by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton and Joey Cavalieri.\n\nThe character was chronologically introduced in ''Adventure Comics'' #464 (April 1979), but was unnamed in that comic. He was, however, named in his next appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #281 (April 1981) and later, became Blackwing in ''Wonder Woman'' #297 (August 1982). Also, worth to note, the original story in ''Adventure Comics'' was intended for ''All Star Comics'' #75. Charlie was drawn as a teen in that story, but his next appearance (only three years later) depicts him as a young adult who graduated from law school.\n\nIn his mid-teens, Charles Bullock was searching for a direction in life. The teenager found it after he helped fight off street punks alongside Wildcat (Ted Grant) and was invited to join him at his gym. Charlie attended law school and later became a junior partner and top-notch researcher to the law firm called Cranston, Grayson and Wayne. When a criminal named Karnage broke into the office looking for his boss, Arthur Cranston, this, and another event, led him to become the costumed hero Blackwing. Although his first outing as a crime fighter proved unsuccessful when he was captured by the costumed villain Boa's gang, Blackwing managed to contribute in freeing the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)]] from Boa's giant snake and recorded some evidence that was used to put the mastermind and his men away.\n\nSince then, Blackwing has never appeared again in any other published story.\n\n==Blaze==\n{{main|Blaze and Satanus}}\n\n==Block==\n'''Block''' is a young Maori woman living in Melbourne, Australia, the woman dubbed the '''Human Block''' was once inexplicably struck by lightning and survived the incident. Unknown to her, this similar event had happened to many other individuals throughout time and was in fact the Speed Force imbuing her with speed-related abilities. In her then-present time\u20141957\u2014Block acted as a side show attraction in a carnival, the prize of $1,000 going to whoever could move her, which was failed by many, as she had manipulated her body density. One drunken man staggered onto the stage to accept her challenge, making her move by insulting her Maori heritage rather than physically moving her. Angered, she immediately struck out at him and instigated a small brawl, tearing through the crowd before someone hastily drew their firearm on her and shot, only to find that not even bullets affected her. Before the now-turned mob could attack her, Zoom, accompanied by his newly recruited acolytes the Folded Man and Magali, appeared and teleported her outside of the carnival grounds. Being offered the chance to embrace her abilities and live as a godlike being after mastering them, she did not hesitate to join Zoom and his quest to kill the \"evil\" Flash. Along with the other Acolytes, she would train for what would be an unknown amount of time to kill the Flash, facing off with Zoom in his place. It is unknown how long this training took place, as they stated that, over the course of centuries, this team trained to take on the Flash and when they reached older age, Magali would revert them back to their original ages when joining. Unknown to Block, Zoom is actually the one to have orchestrated her joining him to begin with, appearing to the drunk man who challenged her, while convincing him that the way to make her move was to attack her heritage, as he had been keeping close watch on her for some time.\n\n=== Powers and abilities of Block ===\nBeing imbued with the Speed Force, Block has the unique ability to slow down her atoms. In doing this, they become denser than steel and grant her invulnerability, super-strength and immobility. She can possibly slow down other speedsters, if not other people as well, through physical touch, as she stopped the Top's ability to spin and was able to hold Zoom in place in a headlock. After training centuries with Zoom, she is a deadly fighter. Recently, she was able to stop the molecules around herself to make the air unbreakable.\n\n=== Block in other media ===\nBlock appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Blocked\", portrayed by [[Erin Cummings]]. '''Vanessa Jansen''', nicknamed \"Block\" by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Black]], was a weapons dealer who worked for the East Street Skulls gang until she was betrayed and sent to [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]] for four years. After becoming a [[metahuman]] with the ability to create boxes of dense air and getting out of Iron Heights, both by unknown means, she sought revenge on her former gang she was stopped by the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]] and [[XS (comics)|XS]]. Before the heroes could re-incarcerate Jansen, she was attacked by [[Cicada (comics)|Cicada]]. XS ran her to the hospital, but Jansen died of her injuries on the way there.\n\n==Blok==\n{{main|Blok (comics)}}\n\n==Blockbuster==\n{{main|Blockbuster (DC Comics)}}\n\n==Bloodsport==\n{{main|Bloodsport (comics)}}\n\n==Blue Beetle==\n{{Main|Blue Beetle}}\n\n==Blue Devil==\n{{Main|Blue Devil (DC Comics)}}\n\n==Bombshell==\n{{main|Bombshell (DC Comics)}}\n\n==Boodikka==\n{{Main|Boodikka}}\n\n==Bolphunga==\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Bolphunga\n|CBDBid = 13140\n|GCDid = Bolphunga\n}}\n'''Bolphunga''' is an extraterrestrial bounty hunter in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 2) #188 (May 1985).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/39966/\n|title=Green Lantern (vol. 2) #188\n|publisher=The Grand Comics Database\n|access-date=2012-05-30\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Bolphunga the Unrelenting has a love of destruction and plots to make a name for himself by challenging the most feared and mysterious beings in creation, fixating on [[Green Lantern]]s.

He is in Mogo's story, on which he is described as an undefeated and merciless warrior who is determined to prove himself the most powerful being by defeating and destroying the most powerful warriors in the universe. He then seeks to challenge [[Mogo]], whom he initially believed to be just another Green Lantern, in a mysterious green planet, but eventually sees his mistake and, apparently, meets his demise when Mogo is revealed to be the planet itself and captures him.\n\n==Booster Gold==\n{{Main|Booster Gold}}\n\n==Sy Borgman==\n'''Sy Borgman''' is a retired scooter-bound U.S. agent with some cybernetic enhancements and an ally of [[Harley Quinn]] that first appeared in ''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #2 (March 2014) as part of ''[[The New 52]]''.\n\nSy Borgman is a retired U.S. agent formerly called '''Syborg''' who was rendered scooter-bound and got cybernetic enhancements after stopping a terrorist plot. When Harley Quinn heads to her nursing home appointment, Sy Borgman recognizes her causing Harley to close the door behind her. He explains his history to her and states how he must use a scooter due to the weight of the cybernetics affecting his aged body. Sy wants to help Harley by targeting the gang that was responsible for his current cybernetic state.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #4. DC Comics.</ref> While going over the files, Harley and Sy start with Igor Lenivetskin, who is in a coma. They were able to sever the tubes going into him and set his body to explode. The second target is Ivana Brekemoff. Sy states Ivana will be more difficult than Igor. Upon entering the mansion by force, Harley and Sy confront Ivana who starts using an RPG on them, which blows up the mansion.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #5. DC Comics.</ref> Emerging unscathed, Harley and Sy flee from the police helicopter while throwing Ivana to her death. Their third target is Alexei \"the Bear\" Medvedenko, who currently works as a security guard at the Prospect Park Zoo. When they arrive, they find that Alexei had been torn apart by the zoo animals he released upon hearing that they were coming for him. The other people that Alexei called were also on the files and consist of Kosta Armanoleg, Borya Tatierski, Yuri Beyznatofin, and Zena Bendemova. Harley and Sy send explosive bagels their way, where Kosta, Yuri, and three of Kosta's henchwomen were caught in the explosions. Harley brings a metal pipe down on Borya's head, leaving Zena as the remaining target. While it was mentioned that Zena was an ex-lover of Sy, she is caught by surprise when Sy sends her scooter into Zena enough to send her flying into the horns of a rhinoceros. Then it comes to the final target that Sy foreshadowed, where he and Harley head to Coney Island and break into the bedroom of a man named Chuck. After a monologue by Sy about the car that Chuck sold him, Harley kicks Chuck out the window where he falls into the streets below. While Sy wanted to finish off Chuck, he relents.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #6.

Sy still managed to win his bets and allows Harley to pay for the meal that follows. Harley later packs Sy's wheelchair into his car and sees him off.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #10. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Sy Borgman in other media===\nSy Borgman appears in the [[adult animation]] series ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Jason Alexander]]. This version is a cyborg landlord who used to work for the CIA as a fixer. Introduced in the episode \"Finding Mr. Right\", he reminds his tenant [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] of the rules before evicting her and her friends for breaking them. In the episode \"Being Harley Quinn\", Borgman finds Ivy and her friends' comatose bodies, assumes they are dead, and nearly kills them. Impressed by his skill, however, [[Harley Quinn]] offers him a place in her crew. In \"L.O.D.R.S.V.P.\", it is revealed that Borgman has a scientist sister named Mirielle. In the 1980s, he asked her to fuse a monkey and an octopus together into a \"monkeypus\" to assist him in the field. During the procedure however, the monkey escaped and fused Mirielle with the octopus, turning her into a mutant monster. Feeling guilty, Borgman hid her away in an abandoned mall. In the present, Borgman has [[Doctor Psycho]] use his psychic powers to help the former communicate and reconcile with Mirielle before releasing her onto the streets of [[Gotham City]], where she goes on a rampage. In \"Dye Hard\", Psycho, having left the crew after being enraged by Harley in a previous episode, takes control of an army of [[Parademon]]s and traps her in a force-field in an attempt to take over Gotham and exact revenge on her. Borgman gives his right eye to her as a memento before sacrificing himself to destroy the force-field so she can escape. In \"Lover's Quarrel\", Harley learns Borgman put a digital backup of his mind in the eye, allowing him to help [[Kite Man]] create anti-mind control devices to combat Doctor Psycho. As of \"A Thief, A Mole, An Orgy\", [[King Shark]] downloads Borgman's consciousness into [[Catwoman]]'s apartment's [[smart home hub]].\n\n==Bouncing Boy==\n{{Main|Bouncing Boy}}\n\n==Bozo the Iron Man==\n{{main|Bozo the Iron Man}}\n\n==Brain==\n{{Main|Brain (DC Comics)}}\n\n==Brain Wave==\n{{Main|Brain Wave (character)}}\n\n==Brainiac==\n{{Main|Brainiac (character)}}\n\n==Brainiac 2==\n{{Main|Vril Dox}}\n\n==Brainiac 5==\n{{Main|Brainiac 5}}\n\n==Brainiac 8==\n{{Main|Brainiac 8}}\n\n==Brainwave==\n{{Main|Brainwave (character)}}\n\n==Brick==\n{{main|Brick (character)}}\n\n==Bronze Tiger==\n{{Main|Bronze Tiger}}\n\n==Brother Blood==\n{{Main|Brother Blood}}\n\n==Brutale==\n{{main|Brutale (DC Comics)}}\n\n==Bug-Eyed Bandit==\n{{main|Bug-Eyed Bandit}}\n\n==Bulleteer==\n{{main|Bulleteer}}\n\n==Bulletman and Bulletgirl==\n{{Main|Bulletman and Bulletgirl}}\n\n==Bumblebee==\n{{Main|Bumblebee (comics)}}\n\n==Bushido==\n{{main|Bushido (comics)}}\n\n==Byth Rok==\n'''Byth Rok''' is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC comics]], and who is commonly known as a recurring enemy of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[Hawkman]]. He was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Joe Kubert]], and first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #34 (February/March 1961), titled \"Creature of a Thousand Shapes\".\n\nOn the alien planet Thanagar, a scientist named Krotan developed a pill that would empower the mind to control the molecular formation of the body. Just as he was about to swallow it, a thief named Byth assaulted him and swallowed the pill. Byth first transformed into a bird and left (via spaceship) to commit crimes on other planets. [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and his wife, [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Hol|Shayera]], tracked his rocket to Earth.\n\nFor many years, Byth would escape on several occasions only to be captured again by Hawkman and Hawkwoman.<ref>''Action Comics'' #588-589</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Hawkworld]]'' mini-series, Byth is a corrupt Wingman commander and Katar Hol's superior. He manipulated a drug-induced Katar into killing his father, aiding his rise to power.<ref>''Hawkworld'' #2 (1989) \"Freefall\"</ref> Now Administrator of Protection, he gains his shape-shifting powers from a new drug called Krotan. Katar Hol, with the help of Shayera Thal, uncovers his schemes but Byth escapes arrest.<ref>''Hawkworld'' #3 (1989) \"Phoenix Flight\"</ref> He flees to Earth and runs criminal operations in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. He supplies Carl Sands with a shadow generator.<ref>''Hawkworld'' (vol. 2) #5 (October 1990) \"War of the Shadows\"</ref> He is later captured,<ref>''Hawkworld'' (vol. 2) #9 (March 1991) \"Hawkwoman Caged!\"</ref> and returned to Thanagar.<ref>''Hawkworld'' (vol. 2) #10 (April 1990) \"Images\"</ref>\n\nByth was apparently defeated for good by the then recently resurrected [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]] and [[Hawkgirl#Kendra Saunders|Kendra Saunders]].\n\nIn [[The New 52]] reboot of DC's continuity, Lord Byth is shown to be responsible for the creation of [[Ultra the Multi-Alien]] where he had combined the DNA of the alien prisoners in order to make Ultra the Multi-Alien the Slayer of Worlds.<ref>''Justice League United'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter consuming the Changeling Pill (or Krotan), Byth has the ability to shape-change into any other person or animal at will, whether they were indigenous to Thanagar or originated on an alien world (including Earth). There appears to be no physical restriction in terms of mass or volume when it comes to Byth's shape-shifting talents.\n\n===Byth Rok in other media===\n* Byth appeared in ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"Flight Club\", voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. He is the leader of a band of Thanagarian outlaws being interred in an intergalactic prison.\n* Byth appeared in issue #9 of comic book series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|The All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''.
