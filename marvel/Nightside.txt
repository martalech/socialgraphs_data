He first appeared in ''Night Thrasher'' (vol. 2) #3 (October 1993), and was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and Ken Lashley. Donyell is the older half-brother<ref>''Night Thrasher'' (vol 2) #14</ref> of [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Dwayne Michael Taylor]], the original Night Thrasher.\n\n'''Donyell Taylor''' is the product of a one-night stand between his unnamed mother and Daryl Taylor, father of Dwayne Taylor. Daryl Taylor was a rich business man who had turned the inheritance from the deaths of his parents into a hundred times the amount he was given. With it he set up charitable foundations like the Taylor Foundation. Daryl had been married to Dwayne's mother Melody since they were 18 years old. Daryl met Donyell's mother while at the bar in the Fairmont Hotel in Chicago. Daryl paid Donyell's mother a check worth six figures to keep quiet of their affair after she revealed she was pregnant.  Donyell resented Dwayne for having the money and the family he never had. Dwayne resented the notion that his life was somehow any better because he barely remembered his parents, who were murdered by Silhouette's father [[Andrew Chord]].\n\nDonyell took the name Bandit and began targeting Night Thrasher's old foes to prove he was superior to Dwayne. Dwayne would later endure a severe beating at Bandit's hands.<ref>''Night Thrasher'' (vol 2) #7</ref> Later wanting a rematch, Bandit abducts [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] keeping her tied to a chair under blinding lights in order to lure Dwayne into a confrontation, but Dwayne wins the rematch.<ref>From ''Night Thrasher'' (vol 2) #7 and 8</ref> Donyell begins sleeping with Silhouette soon afterwards. When Night Thrasher, Silhouette, and various other members of the New Warriors are sent back in time Donyell joins Hindsight Lad, Sprocket, and his father's killer Andrew Chord in creating a new team of New Warriors to save the originals. The team consisted of Bandit, [[Hindsight (comics)|Hindsight Lad]], Turbo, [[Darkhawk]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], and [[Alex Power|Powerpax]]. Donyell later comes to terms with his half-brother, finding common ground during their battle against the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]] when the Warriors were returned to the proper time period.\n\nDonyell and Silhouette quit the New Warriors soon after and moved to Chicago. This was the last time that they were seen for several years.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol 1) #51 and ''Night Thrasher'' (vol 2) #13 & 14</ref> The next time Donyell shows up, he has apparently been seeing [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit's]] ex-wife [[Bella Donna (comics)#Bella Donna Boudreaux|Belladonna]] for a few months. No one knows what exactly happened between Silhouette and Bandit in Chicago that caused them to separate. It is clear by their conversation at Dwayne's grave site that they are no longer a couple.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol 4) #7 and 8</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Civil War (comics)|Stamford accident]], Donyell Taylor had taken over the Taylor Foundation at the death of his half-brother.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol 4) #3</ref> It is also revealed that Donyell suffered from a car accident that caused his legs to be amputated.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Donyell denies involvement in the latest incarnation of the New Warriors.{{issue|date=January 2013}} However, he reveals that a large amount of money was drained from the Taylor Foundation against his wishes and only he and his brother Dwayne had access to those accounts.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nLater it is revealed that Donyell Taylor did not, in fact, lose his legs at all. The last panel shows him standing up and staring out of a window, with the image of Night Thrasher behind him, suggesting that he took his brother's alias and costume, and now leads the New Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol 4) #6</ref> Apparently, Dwayne and Donyell reconciled at some point, as he is seen expressing regret for the earlier hostility in their relationship at Dwayne's grave.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol 4) #7</ref>\n\nDonyell considered disbanding the New Warriors after teammate [[Tattoo (comics)|Longstrike]] was murdered by one of the members of the new Zodiac. The remaining members convince him not to.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Donyell has problems with [[Jubilee (comics)|Wondra]] sowing seeds of dissent among the rest of the group.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Donyell frequently disappears during battles and does not divulge his comings and goings with his teammates. He downloaded information from Machinesmith, who he claimed was creating a techno-organic virus.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIt is revealed that Donyell has taken in abused children and teenagers such as Kaz, Aja, and Grace to help him by making them members of the New Warriors support staff.{{issue|date=January 2013}} They have helped in turning one of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s former hideouts into a base for the team.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He rescued each of them from abusive environments and has been trying to give them a new life.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nWhen the [[Skrull]]s [[Secret Invasion|invade Earth]], Donyell begins to wonder if the Night Thrasher that perished in Stamford was actually a Skrull. He travels to one of the New Warriors old safe houses, hoping to acquire a sample of his brother's DNA. [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and his Counter Initiative arrive, and attack Donyell, believing him to be a Skrull impostor. They ask him if he is or is not Dwayne, which he doesn't answer, which just escalates things. The rest of the New Warriors then arrive on the scene.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #15</ref>\n\nA battle occurs between the two teams, but is quickly stopped by Donyell, who then shocks both groups by revealing his identity. They call a truce after Donyell asks Justice to help him find Dwayne's body. They arrive at a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] where Justice believe it is being held, only to find it under siege by a Skrull assault force. While the Warriors and the Counter Initiative battle the Skrulls and evacuate the surviving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Donyell and Justice find Dwayne's corpse, along with the remains of [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]] and [[Namorita]]. Donyell takes a sample of Dwayne's DNA and runs it through his armor's computer, then does the same with Microbe and Namorita. The results test positive and Donyell tells Justice that they're taking the bodies with them. Justice agrees and the two teams depart as Army reinforcements arrive to deal with the remaining Skrulls. Later, the two teams bury the remains of their friends in a short memorial service and part on good terms.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #16</ref>\n\nFollowing a confrontation with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s \"capekillers\", [[Redneck (comics)|Skybolt]] and [[Stacy X|Ripcord]] are killed, and Donyell revealed that he had been working on a time machine, so that he could save the former New Warriors from their deaths in Stamford, and by extension, the New Warriors who had perished since then.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #17</ref> When the machine is activated, it instead sends the New Warriors into a future where Iron Man has taken the Registration Act to the extreme, a future where all superpowered beings have been removed from the general populace, and the people are under a rule of tyranny. Confronting Iron Man, Donyell discovers that it is not Tony Stark in the suit, but Dwayne, returned from the dead.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #18</ref> Despite having misgivings about Dwayne's totalitarian rule, Donyell's need to reconnect with his brother leads him to betray and capture the other New Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #19</ref> However, after Dwayne kills Tony Stark (who in this timeline had taken on the identity of Night Thrasher) in cold blood, Donyell comes to his senses, rescuing the others and freeing the incarcerated superheroes. Donyell is then attacked by Dwayne, and is forced to kill him. Upon their return to the present, Donyell disbands the New Warriors, believing they will never be able to trust him again.<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 4) #20</ref>\n\nLater, a man with a Night Thrasher outfit appears among the [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]] members that arrive at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] during the assault of the Thor clone called [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> He is later confirmed to be Donyell Taylor, who becomes the group's benefactor (and second in command) when the group goes on the run from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], changing the group name to \"Avengers Resistance\".<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref> When the Avengers Resistance aids the seceding [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] against a group of other Initiative teams, Donyell is shot in the head by [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]]. He survives, and is captured by Osborn and the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], who make an offer to bring his brother back.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref> However, the Avengers Resistance comes to rescue him.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #30</ref>\n\nWhile Counter Force moves to a new hideout, Donyell stays behind now that Norman Osborn knows who he is.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #31</ref>\n\nCounter Force hears about the incident at [[Soldier Field]] involving [[Volstagg]] and the [[U-Foes]]. Justice deduces that Norman Osborn orchestrated this. While Counter Force contacts the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] and the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], Donyell is advised to send e-mails containing evidence of the U-Foes' payoffs, which Donyell objected stating that Norman Osborn would make up some excuse to cover it. Justice concludes that they will have to attack Camp [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] to expose Norman Osborn for what he is.<ref>Avengers: The Initiative #32</ref>\n\nWhen visiting his brother's grave, Donyell is conflicted if he should go with the deal Norman Osborn and the Hood gave him. Counter Force takes the fight to Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. and ends up fighting the Hood's gang. They are knocked down by the Hood's new Asgardian weaponry. When Donyell arrives, the Hood gives him an opportunity to prove himself by killing [[Tigra]].<ref>Avengers: The Initiative #33</ref>\n\nThe Hood demands that Donyell kill Tigra if he wants his brother revived. Instead, Donyell attacks the Hood and is joined by Tigra as the Hood uses the [[Norn Stones]] to empower some of the cadets on his side.<ref>Avengers: The Initiative #34</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities of Donyell Taylor===\nBandit is a mutant with bioelectrical powers similar to an [[electric eel]] that require physical contact and a conductive medium to work. He can channel an electrical charge strong enough to stun, injure, or kill through someone just by touching them. He augments the range of this power by shooting special wire-tethered quarrels from his wristbow. He has also demonstrated superhuman speed and reflexes on par with [[Midnight's Fire]] and [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]]. Donyell is an accomplished [[marksman]], acrobat, and martial artist.<ref name=\"newwarriors.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.newwarriors.com/html/banditprofile.html | title=BANDIT }}</ref>\n\nBandit carries a specialized wrist mounted [[crossbow]], that fires wire-tethered quarrels tipped with miniature grappling barbs which would penetrate an opponent's flesh and then open up beneath the skin. He then uses his powers to send a debilitating [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Electric manipulation|bio-electric]] charge along the [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] tether, basically making himself a living taser. He also carries a variety of throwing stars.<ref name=\"newwarriors.com\"/>\n\nHis Night Thrasher armor, apart from giving him added protection, enables him to project form-energy weapons, such as a bo staff, escrima sticks, and wrist blades. At one point he banged the sticks together to create an energy shockwave.\nHe also displayed a jet pack and used Pym Particles to shrink himself and others down.\n\nDonyell is an accomplished thief and scientist, it is revealed in New Warriors, Vol. 4, that he was able to empower de-powered mutants by stealing powerful technology from the likes of the Avengers. The full capabilities of this knowledge are unknown, but he is feasibly capable of producing incredibly powerful enhancing technology/exoskeletons.\n\n===Other versions of Donyell Taylor===\nAn alternate version of Donyell was revealed in [[What If (comics)|What If...?]] vol. 2 #81, living in the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. When that world got attacked by [[Galactus]], Bandit was killed in battle. One of the main features of the story was the fact that Donyell and his brother Night Thrasher were more reconciled emotionally than they are in the 616 universe.\n\n==Nightcrawler==\n{{main|Nightcrawler (comics)}}\n\n==Nighthawk==\n===Kyle Richmond===\n{{main|Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n===Joaquin Pennyworth===\n{{main|Nighthawk (Joaquin Pennyworth)}}\n\n===Neil Richmond===\n{{main|Nighthawk (Neil Richmond)}}\n\n===Jack Norris===\n{{main|Nighthawk (Jack Norris)}}\n\n===Tilda Johnson===\n{{main|Nighthawk (Tilda Johnson)}}\n\n==Nightmare==\n{{main|Nightmare (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n== Nightmask ==\n{{main|Nightmask}}\n\n===Keith Remsen===\n{{main|Nightmask (Keith Remsen)}}\n\n===Izanami Randall and Trull===\n{{main|Nightmask (newuniversal)}}\n\n===Adam Blackveil===\n{{main|Nightmask (Adam Blackveil)}}\n\n==Nightshade==\n{{main|Nightshade (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n==Nightside==\n{{main|Nightside (comics)}}\n'''Nightside''' (originally code-named '''Nightshade''') is a member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]].

They send help for Martha and thank her for saving them. Martha reflects on the experience, finding that she enjoyed it, and contemplates the possibility of taking up superheroism.<ref name=Seven-and-a-half>{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[John Barber (comics)|John Barber]]\n| penciller = [[David Lopez (artist)|David L\u00f3pez]]\n| inker = \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez\n| story = Martha Johansson vs. Quentin Quire in: 7\u00bd\n| title = Nation X\n| volume = \n| issue = #2\n| date = March 2010\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the separation between the [[X-Men]] in two teams, Martha choose to stay at Utopia. At the request of [[Kenji Uedo|Zero]], she joins the Lights of [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]]. Through the use of Zero's techno-organic powers, Martha has received a new physical body very similar to Zero's, with her front lobe exposed. She has subsequently been seen sharing Zero's bed, though whether this is a depiction of intimacy or merely the only practical way for her to keep her new body is undetermined.\nDuring Zero's rampage on Utopia, Martha and Hope work together stopping him and sacrificing her new body in the process, but Hope saves her and she is back in a new brain canister. It is revealed that Martha's powers could negate Zero's with ease.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nAfter [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s death, one of his last requests was for [[Spider-Man]] to join the Jean Grey School as a teacher for the Special Class so that he could identify a mole that Wolverine believed was among the student body. While Martha was one of the suspects, Spider-Man came to trust her while Martha respected him as a teacher, helping to shield his mind from an attempted telepathic probe by [[Rachel Summers]] and later protecting his conscious mind when he was forced to take on a new [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] to stop a symbiote invasion of a S.W.O.R.D. satellite. It was eventually revealed that the mole was Ernst, who had been working with [[Mister Sinister]] to provide him with DNA samples of the X-Men in exchange for him giving Martha a new body. However, when the time came for Sinister to uphold his end of the bargain, he just placed Martha in a clone of Storm's body rather than recreating her old one, prompting Martha to reject this offer and convincing Ernst to remove her from the clone. Once Sinister was defeated, Martha apparently began dating Eye-Guy, whose new perceptions had expanded to a point where he claimed that he could even 'see' Martha 'smile' if he looked at her the right way.\n\nMartha is a [[telepathy|telepath]], able to communicate mentally and manipulate the minds of other beings. In her introduction as an isolated brain Martha uses her telepathy to communicate through others near her, but typically only directs her telepathic speech to her classmate Ernst, who then repeats her comments to others.<ref name=\"NXM136\"/> She is able to telepathically override and control the motor functions of others. This allows her to temporarily negate the powers of other mutants, though she must be at close range to do so.<ref name=Seven-and-a-half /> She can also project her consciousness into the minds of others, taking complete possession of their bodies while leaving her brain unconscious and vulnerable.<ref>''Curse of the Mutants: X-Men vs. Vampires #1''</ref>\n\nMartha can broadcast disruptive psionic distortion (called \"psycho-[[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]]\") into her immediate environment that clouds the minds of others, inhibiting their concentration and autonomic nervous functions to the point of [[stupor]].<ref name=\"NXM119\"/> Her abilities in this area are shown to be strong enough to overpower the subconscious defenses of Emma Frost when Emma was in her diamond form and unable to access her own telepathy.<ref name=\"NXM119\">''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #119</ref> However, Martha's \"psycho-chaff\" is not strong enough to bypass Emma Frost's conscious telepathic abilities, as Emma was able to easily overpower Martha and regain control of her motor functions after shifting out of her diamond form and regaining her telepathy.<ref name=\"NXM120\">''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #120</ref>\n\nWithout a body, Martha is limited in all other areas. She, as a brain, travels in a fluid-filled jar with technology (invented by fellow Xavier Institute student Quentin Quire) that allows it to float, and is anchored via a metal chain. The floats offer her some level of mobility, moving in the direction of her choosing.<ref name=\"NXM136\">''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #136</ref>\n\nIt was also stated that, in her original body, Martha's blood had luminescent properties; Martha wrote a note to her parents using her own glowing blood when she ran away from home.<ref name=\"NXM118\">''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #118</ref>\n\nIt is unknown if Martha had Zero's powers in the body he created for her, but it seems she was dependent on Zero's concentration for her form to be maintained.\n\n===Other versions of No-Girl===\n* In the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Martha Johansson was shown incarcerated in Fortress X's X-Brig as part of the 'Moira' personality's attempt to prevent telepaths exposing her manipulation of reality.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245</ref>\n* Johansson is present in the alternate future [[Here Comes Tomorrow]], set some 150 years from the present. She is still close friends with Ernst, who is revealed to be a benevolent reincarnation of [[Cassandra Nova]]. Along with Nova, she stands alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], E.V.A., the [[Stepford Cuckoos|Three-In-One]], and Beak's Grandson [[Tito Jerome Bohusk]] against a [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]-possessed version of the X-Man Beast, who prematurely revives [[Jean Grey]] in order to control her and the Phoenix Force.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n*In [[Chris Claremont]]'s ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' storyline, which takes place some 20 years ahead of standard X-Men continuity, Martha Johansson has taken on the role of Cerebra.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n==No-Name==\n{{main|No-Name}}\n\n==Nocturne==\n===Talia Wagner===\n{{main|Nocturne (Talia Wagner)}}\n\n==Nomad==\n{{main|Nomad (comics)}}\n\n===Steve Rogers===\n{{main|Captain America}}\n\n===Edward Ferbel===\n{{main|Nomad (Edward Ferbel)}}\n\n===Jack Monroe===\n{{main|Jack Monroe (comics)}}\n\n===Rikki Barnes===\n{{main|Rikki Barnes}}\n\n===Ian Rogers===\n{{main|Nomad (Ian Rogers)}}\n\n==Dakota North==\n{{main|Dakota North (comics)}}\n\n==Northstar==\n{{main|Northstar (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n==Nova==\n===Frankie Raye===\n{{main|Nova (Frankie Raye)}}\n\n===Richard Rider===\n{{main|Nova (Richard Rider)}}\n\n===Sam Alexander===\n{{main|Nova (Sam Alexander)}}\n\n==Cassandra Nova==\n{{main|Cassandra Nova}}\n\n==Nth Man==\n{{main|Nth Man}}\n\n==Nuke==\n===Albert Gaines===\n'''Nuke''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a member of the alternate-reality [[Squadron Supreme]]. Another version of the character appears in the title [[Supreme Power]].\n\n====Squadron Supreme====\nAlbert was a nuclear plant worker when he accidentally gained his superhuman powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He became '''Nuke''', an adventurer and member of the [[Squadron Supreme]], and a super-powered hero who kept his identity a secret from even his own family.\n\nAlongside the other Squadron members, he became mind-controlled by the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]]. He was used along with the other members as pawns in the Over-Mind's conquest of \"Other-Earth,\" until he was freed by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He battled and defeated the Over-Mind and Null the Living Darkness alongside the Squadron and the Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #112-114</ref>\n\nAlongside the Squadron Supreme, Nuke assumes control of the United States government, and publicly reveals his true identity.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1</ref> Nuke then discovers out that his parents were dying from radiation poisoning, brought on by exposure to his own powers. Nuke turned to [[Tom Thumb (comics)#Squadron Supreme|Tom Thumb]] to help find a cure; when Tom cannot and his parents die, a grief-stricken Nuke vows revenge and goes on a rampage.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #2</ref> [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]] restrains him by encasing him in an energy bubble construct, but Nuke's powers burn up the oxygen supply inside the bubble and he suffocates.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #3</ref>\n\nAlbert Gaines was imbued with superhuman powers as a result of mutation through exposure to radioactive waste products, giving him immunity to the effects of radiation and the ability to generate nuclear energy within his body, which he can mentally manipulate to project destructive bursts. This has the side effect of him continually giving off low-level radiation. Towards the end of his life, Nuke also wears an air-conditioned radiation containment suit equipped with a radiometer to measure his radiation output, designed by Tom Thumb. Nuke is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received coaching from Nighthawk. Nuke suffers from emotional and psychological instability that culminates to insanity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n====Supreme Power====\nNuke is introduced as Mr. Al Gaines, a young, severely depressed man living underground in a fallout shelter alone because his body emits high levels of radiation he cannot control.{{Issue|date=March 2009}} He is near invulnerable, can fly, and apparently superhumanly strong. General Alexander offers him a suit that will control his radiation output in return for fighting [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]], whom General Alexander directs the blame for his condition.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn a fight with [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] the combination of Hyperion's eye-beams, Nuke's radiation blast, and [[Arcanna]] Jones' quantum alterations creates a brief and unexplainable skip in reality that sends Gaines, Jones, Dr. [[Emil Burbank]] and [[Shape (comics)|Raleigh Lund]] two years into the future.{{issue|date=January 2013}} In this alternate future it is mentioned that [[Doctor Spectrum]] killed him at some point.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nNuke joins the government's Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 2 #1</ref> During a session in which all the Squadron members are asked to fill out information about themselves, Nuke's parents are revealed deceased.{{issue|date=January 2013}} In the first mission he is high up in the sky to be used as a tactical nuke, the person of last resort.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n====Nuke in other media====\nNuke appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} This version is an alien and a member of the Squadron Supreme. In the episode \"Avengers' Last Stand\", the Avengers raid the Squadron's citadel and discover it is draining energy from the Earth's core in order to restore Nuke, who destroys the citadel and reunites with his leader, Nighthawk. In \"Avengers Underground\", Iron Man, Thor, and Falcon trap Zarda and Nuke in the same prison box. As part of his contingency plan however, Nighthawk teleports Nuke and Hyperion to his tower, where Hyperion absorbs Nuke's power to help him destroy the Earth. Ultimately, the Avengers foil Nighthawk's plans and remand all of the Squadron Supreme to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].\n\n===Frank Simpson===\n{{main|Nuke (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n==Nuklo==\n{{main|Nuklo}}\n\n==Numinus==\n'''Numinus''' is a cosmic entity claiming to be the guiding spirit of the Universe.\n\n==Nyx==\n{{Comics character list header\n|debut      = ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]: No Road Home'' #1\n|debutmo    = April\n|debutyr    = 2019\n|debut?     = \n|creators   = [[Al Ewing]], [[Jim Zub]], [[Mark Waid]], [[Joshua James Shaw]]\n|species    = [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]]\n|teams      = <!-- optional -->\n|abilities  = Superhuman strength, speed and immortality <br>[[Darkness|Umbra]]kinesis<br>[[Parthenogenesis]]<br>[[Teleportation]]\n|alias      = <!-- optional -->\n|name       = Nyx\n|Marvelwiki = \n|Marveldb   = \n|CBDBid     = 96956\n|GCDid      = \n}}\n'''Nyx''' was created by [[Al Ewing]], [[Jim Zub]], [[Mark Waid]] and [[Joshua James Shaw]], based on the [[Nyx|primordial goddess of darkness]] of the same name and first appeared in ''Avengers: No Road Home'' #1 and making her last appearance in ''Avengers: No Road Home'' #10. She's not to be confused with [[Nox (comics)|Nox]], based on the same goddess, who was revealed to be a usurper.<ref>{{cite tweet |user= JimZub|number= 1097668925670809600|date= 18 February 2019|title= Jim Zub answering CBR's tweet \"Avengers: A Minor Villain Just Killed Some of Marvel's Strongest Gods\"}}</ref>\n\nNyx was born in the [[Ginungagap|pure emptiness]] and was one of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] who were once worshiped as gods by the Greeks, as she was worshiped as the Goddess of the Night and the Darkness. At some point, she gave birth to her children Hypnos, Oizys, and the twins Dolos and Apate. Due to her malevolent nature, [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] imprisoned Nyx in such a manner that she would remain trapped until \"the sun was parted from the earth,\" and hid the Night Shards within her soul in three secret places throughout the Universe.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #1-5. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDuring ''Avengers: No Surrender'', where the [[Elder of the Universe]], [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], fought each other, the Earth was removed from its orbit and it was returned at the end of the game, but its removal ended Nyx's containment. In revenge, she sought out to bring an eternal night throughout the Universe, even on planets with multiple suns and bases contained within suns. She took her revenge on the Olympians and with the help of her children, they killed all of the Olympian gods, including Zeus after retrieving information about her hidden Night Shards. However, Zeus threatened and promised to her that his son, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the \"[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] of the Wronged\" would avenge him. She was then approached by Hercules, [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Hulk]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Rocket Raccoon]], [[Voyager (comics)|Voyager]], [[Monica Rambeau]] and eventually [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan]].Nyx retrieved her Shards of Night from [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], Lord Librarian, and the [[Hyborian Age]], but at the cost of her children's life. After that, with the help of the Cosmic Being, Euphoria, she arrived to her final destination in Long Island, where the One Above All's House of Ideas was. Vision made it through the door entrance of the House of Ideas to stop her from wiping out the existence. During her fight with Vision, he used the powers of the House and with his imagination, constructed many heroes to battle Nyx. She was then killed by Vision by burning her into flames, causing her to be disintegrated.<ref>''Avengers: No Road Home'' #6-10. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Nyx's powers and abilities===\nBeing a goddess of [[darkness]], she can wield the darkness in a physical way, or even to cause someone blindness. Nyx was also capable of conceiving children without a partner, seemingly sired by her strongest feelings at the moment. Nyx possesses superhuman strength even in a weakened state, she was able to break the neck of Zeus and could use her nails as claws and was able to make the Hulk bleed. Nyx was also shown to be able to teleport.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of Marvel Comics characters|Marvel Comics characters: N, List of]]"}}}]}}}}
