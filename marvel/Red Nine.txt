A preview of the title was shown in ''Civil War: The Initiative''.\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first issue of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' was released on 4 April 2007. The [[tagline]] initially used in solicitations was \"Marvel's Army of [[Superhero|Super Heroes]] just became a Super Hero Army\".\n\nThe series was originally solicited as a six issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], but prior to the publication of the first issue, Marvel announced that this had changed and that ''Avengers: The Initiative'' would become an ongoing series, the third regularly published 'Avengers' title from 2007 onwards, after ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"NR\"/>\n\nIssues #20-22 dealt with \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\", the aftermath to Secret Invasion, and [[Christos Gage]] moved to full writing duties.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120810-Initiative-Gage.html Gage: Taking The Initiative Under a Dark Reign], [[Newsarama]], December 10, 2008</ref>\n\nThe series was cancelled after ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35 (April 2010), at the conclusion of the \"[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]\" storyline<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=George |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/106/1061476p1.html |title=Siege Ends the Avengers |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=January 15, 2010 |access-date=January 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119181509/http://comics.ign.com/articles/106/1061476p1.html |archive-date=19 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and replaced by ''[[Avengers Academy]]''.\n\n==Fictional history==\n===First recruit group===\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, the pro-registration side stood victorious and had launched the Fifty State Initiative which called for one [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-sponsored superhero team for each state. The series focused on the training facility located at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]].\n\nThe first group of young heroes has been sent to hero [[recruit training|boot camp]] in Stamford, the site of the explosion that launched the whole Civil War. During the first days training, Trauma, a shapeshifter, loses control of his power and causes Armory to have a panic attack. She accidentally shoots [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]], who was trying to save Cloud 9. Pym and Gyrich agree to conceal the death and expel Armory, but first amputate her alien weaponry, since she'll be an unregistered super. As the young heroes finish the obstacle course, Trauma loses control of his transformation again, first feeding off of Cloud 9's guilt at being responsible for MVP's death, and then transforming into an image of a beaten and bloody [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]] when [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] (Henry Pym) attempts to intervene. As Justice and Gauntlet clean up the situation, Pym is called to the lab where [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] informs him and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] of MVP's anatomy; instead of being enhanced by the Super Soldier Serum as everyone believed, he is actually an \"[[\u00dcbermensch]]\", the ultimate human specimen. As Blitzschlag and Gyrich laud the benefits of such a test subject, Pym again has a crisis of conscience, only enhanced when the German scientist recounts his past \"villainous\" acts (such as the creation of [[Ultron]]) and remarks \"I am your greatest fan.\"<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=Stefano Caselli | Inker = Stefano Caselli  | Story = Hero Moment | Title = Avengers: The Initiative | Volume =  | Issue = #2 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>\n\nA crisis over [[Texas]] occurs involving the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]. Cloud 9, [[Komodo (comics)#Komodo (Melati Kusuma)|Komodo]], [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], Gauntlet, [[War Machine]], Justice and Yellowjacket all arrive on the scene (with Hardball, Gauntlet and Komodo donning jet packs) Cloud 9 is revealed as the best marksman of the bunch when she receives a pulse rifle, but further feel guilt when she blows up a fighter jet and the pilot doesn't eject.\n\nHardball speaks to Komodo about Justice apparently having learned of MVP's fate. While he talks, he turns to see not Komodo but a strange girl sleeping next to him. Komodo is upset that her identity was revealed. Spider-Man battles the duo. He quickly incapacitates War Machine with a blast of webbing that shuts down his armor, but not before War Machine mysteriously states that even though Spider-Man will be stripped of his powers, another Spider-Man will exist. While Komodo fares much better, Spider-Man's wit and a threat that her failure will result in her losing her powers helps him defeat her and slip away easily.<ref name=ai3>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=Stefano Caselli | Inker = Stefano Caselli  | Story = Bug Hunt  | Title = Avengers: The Initiative | Volume =  | Issue = #3 | Date = Aug. 2007  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>\n\nA mysterious third party, which War Machine calls \"Red Team\" and which has been cloaked during the fight, is revealed to be a group of people in duplicate versions of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s Spider-Man armor. The story ends with Komodo's desperate plea not to be stripped of her powers, as she dislikes being normal and considers her other self to be a nobody.<ref name=ai3/>\n\n===World War Hulk===\n{{Main|World War Hulk}}\n\nThe recruits are ordered to stay away from the fighting, but to still help with evacuation efforts. Rage and several other recruits disobey a direct order and go to help the Avengers. They are quickly dispatched by Hulk's Warbound and imprisoned in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Gyrich fears the political fallout, so he orders his '''Shadow Initiative''' to rescue only the six missing recruits. This team consists of [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Trauma (comics)#Terrence Ward|Trauma]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Typhoid Mary (comics)#The Initiative|Mutant Zero]], and the [[Michael Van Patrick#Scarlet Spiders|Scarlet Spiders]]. Hulk eventually comes across the team and Trauma attempts to access Hulk's greatest fear, but Hulk tells him he fears nothing and nearly beats him to death.<ref>''The Initiative'' #5.</ref>\n\nDuring these events Hardball is secretly recruited by HYDRA to steal nanotechnology. While in disguise he sees MVP's body cryogenically frozen, but Justice and Cloud 9 claim to have seen him at his parents\u2019 home. Sgt. Green is mysteriously attacked and can no longer train the recruits.<ref>''The Initiative'' #6.</ref>\n\n===Second recruit group===\nSeveral new Initiative recruits arrive at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], including [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)]], [[Crusader (Marvel Comics)#Z'Reg|Crusader (Z'Reg)]], Melee, [[Geldoff#Earth-616|Geldoff]], [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord (Tako Shamara)]], Geiger, Red Nine, and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]]. These recruits will mainly be trained by the instructor Taskmaster.<ref name=\"AvengInit#8\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N.

KIA also caused injury to many initiative trainees and staff like [[Thor Girl]], Gauntlet, Constrictor and Crusader. He also killed eight S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in his rampage. He is eventually subdued when Cloud 9 uses the knowledge of Michael Van Patrick's crush on her to kiss him and fill him with gas. The reformed [[New Warriors#Counter Force Team|New Warriors]] and New Avengers are able to subdue him and mind wipe him with a device from Baron Von Blitzschlag.\n\n===First graduations===\nSome of the first instalment trainees made it to graduation. The graduating class and their assignments were as follows:\n\n* '''Cloud 9''': Montana - [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]\n* '''Hardball''': Nevada - Heavy Hitters\n* '''Thor Girl''': Georgia - The Cavalry\n* '''Komodo''': Arizona - Desert Stars\n* '''Trauma''': remains on base as a counselor\n* '''Triathlon''' (now going by [[3-D Man]] and sporting the costume of his namesake): Hawaii -Point Men\n* '''Ultra Girl''' (now wearing Ms. Marvel's original costume): Georgia -The Cavalry\n\nJustice, Debrii, Slapstick, Rage, MVP and the two remaining Scarlet Spiders left the Initiative to form '''[[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]]''', described as a counter-initiative that will dedicate themselves to keeping the government program honest.\n\n===More recruits===\nStarting with issue #13, the series features new recruits that will join the squad assembled before the coming of KIA. They are: Annex, [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]], [[Gorilla Girl]], Sunstreak, [[Batwing (Marvel Comics)|Batwing]] and Boulder. <ref name=\"NEW13\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3381.Initiative_Initiation%7Ecolon%7E_The_New_Class  |title=Initiative Initiation: The New Class |access-date=2008-05-02 |work=Marvel.com }}</ref> Less enthusiastic than the first recruits, most of them with criminal records (except Butterball/Boulder who wanted to be there, and Batwing, who was just looking for a cure for his condition) they are there because their alternative to Camp Hammond is the [[Negative Zone]] prison (however, the criminal charges against all but Sunstreak appear to be limited to non-registration). Taskmaster quickly renames Boulder \"Butterball\" in reference to his size. He has been challenged to make Butterball into a good soldier; but because of his invulnerability powers, his physical appearance could not be altered. The recruits break out of the camp due to boredom and decide to go to the beach where they drink and [[nude swimming|skinny dip]], since they would be recognized anywhere else. Sunstreak attempts to have relations with Butterball who refuses and takes their ride and heads back to the camp but encounters Constrictor, Taskmaster, War Machine and Yellowjacket. He lies, claiming to have gone AWOL alone. Although the recruits plan to use this distraction to sneak back on base, they instead help defeat [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)#Firebrand (Russ Broxtel)|Firebrand]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)#Klaus Voorhees|King Cobra]], [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] and [[Mauler (comics)#Brendan Doyle|Mauler]], all of whom wanted revenge on the Taskmaster. Butterball washes out of the program when it is deemed he does not have the appropriate attitude to be a superhero. To ease his disappointment, Taskmaster and Constrictor allow him to take a picture that makes it look like he has defeated them.\n\n===Secret Invasion===\n{{Main|Secret Invasion}}\nThe Revolutionary, a member of Pennsylvania's Liberteens, is actually a Skrull in disguise. He's part of a plot to put \"a [[Skrull]] in every state\" by infiltrating each superhero team of the Initiative.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer =Dan Slott |Cowriters = Christos Gage  | Penciller = Patrick Scherberger  | Inker = David Meikis | Story =State of Readiness | Title = ''Avengers: The Initiative'' | Issue = Annual #1 | Date = Jan. 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> During ''Secret Invasion'' [[Crusader (Marvel Comics)#Crusader (Skrull)|Crusader]] discovers that camp director [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] is actually a Skrull impostor; he almost tells the camp's counselor [[Trauma (comics)#Terrence Ward|Trauma]] but changes his mind. When [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] arrives in Camp Hammond to announce to everyone assembled that the Initiative has been infiltrated by Skrulls, Crusader fears that he will be exposed as a Skrull despite his good intentions. Crusader uses the Freedom Ring to reverse the goggles' power so that they cause 3-D Man to see Crusader as human and all humans as Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14</ref>\n\nLater 'Yellowjacket-Skrull' gives orders to Gauntlet to dispatch the cadets to help the [[Young Avengers]] fight the Skrulls, and [[Geldoff#Earth-616|Proton]] is killed during the battle. The Skrulls defeat the cadets and Young Avengers, but then Nick Fury arrives with his \"commandos.\"<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #15-16</ref><ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref> Meanwhile, [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)]], the only cadet still on Camp Hammond witnessed how \"Yellowjacket\" welcomed a Skrull commander to the base and attempts to learn of their secret plans. During the big fight against the Skrull army, [[Crusader (Marvel Comics)#Crusader .28Skrull.29|Crusader]], (a Skrull who lives on Earth and an Initiative cadet) decided to fight for Earth.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #16\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref>\n\nAfter defeating a Skrull imposter looking like [[Sharon Ventura|'She-Thing']], 3-D Man joined up with the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] and found out that in every Initiative state team is one Skrull-imposter and decided to kill them all. Komodo joined the team as well,<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #16\"/> and they then added her lover Hardball. The Skrull Kill Crew thought they would not be able to track through all the states on time, but then former Avenger [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] appeared with [[Devil-Slayer]], who is a member of the Hawaiian Initiative team, the Point Men. Devil-Slayer's teleportation ability will aid them in killing all Skrull imposters within the Fifty State Initiative.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #17\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #17</ref>\n\nThe group move on to other Initiative bases, killing the Skrull imposters. Delroy Garret's goggles also identify [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]] as a Skrull who is then killed by Cloud 9, who then joins their insurgency with [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. The Skrull then send a broadcast throughout the world, telling their sleeper agents to activate themselves, which sows even more distrust among the remaining heroes. While in Philadelphia, the Revolutionary is revealed as a Skrull and defeated by Gravity and Hope. When they come across a fight between [[Thor Girl]] and [[Ultra Girl]], Delroy's goggles identify Thor Girl as a Skrull. With help from [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], Delroy uses Thor Girl's own hammer to kill the Skrull imposter. Ant-Man manages to escape the Skrulls on the back of a Shock Trooper, and reveals to the Kill Crew the Skrulls' last resort plan; to use all the Initiative bases to create a massive Negative Zone portal that will destroy the entire country. With six bases left, the Krew splits up, and uses the still-living heads of Moonstomp, Catwalk and Dice to help point out Skrulls. Devil-Slayer teleports them to the bases, but collapses under the strain.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>\n\nThe Initiative members combat their Skrull opponents who have received their mission to activate themselves to start distrust among the teams. At the Battalion's HQ, [[Tigra]], Ryder, and Cloud 9 fight a Skrull posing as [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]]. Hardball and Moonstomp help Action Pack fight a Skrull posing as Frog-Man. Gravity and Catwalk help the Great Lakes Avengers fight a Skrull posing as [[Grasshopper (comics)#Skrull imposter|Grasshopper]]. Komodo and Riot help the Command fight a Skrull posing as Conquistador (who assumed a Skrull/[[Devil Dinosaur]]-like form). Dice and Jocasta fight their way through activists to get to the Skrull posing as [[Earth Force (Marvel Comics)#Skyhawk|Skyhawk]] who succeeds in his part of the mission. Delroy Garrett and Ant-Man join the Rangers in fighting a Skrull that posed as [[Red Wolf (comics)#William Talltrees|Red Wolf]]'s wolf companion Lobo. After it is shot by Shooting Star, a crowd uprising occurred when Delroy's goggles identify some of the crowd members as Skrulls. Delroy's goggles are hit by a thrown rock giving Delroy's allies a hard time figuring out who's a Skrull and who is not. During the struggle, Delroy discovers that he can see who is a Skrull without his goggles since the Tri-Force energy is inside him. This turns the tides against those Skrulls disguised as crowd members. During the fights across the USA, [[Freedom Force (comics)|Spinner]] and [[Liberty Legion#Liberteens .282007.29|Whiz-Kid]] both apparently die in various fights. At the final fight at Camp Hammond, Crusader kills Criti Noll, the Yellow Jacket imposter, and then 3-D Man shoots Crusader (who hid his Skrull heritage from the others but was fighting for Earth). Before he disappeared, Crusader stated that he wished \"it could've ended differently\".<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref>\n\n===Dark Reign===\n{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}\nFollowing the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, the Fifty-State Initiative is shut down and the Thunderbolts Initiative is established when [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] takes over.<ref>''Dark Reign'' #1</ref>\n\nThose that had been replaced by Skrulls alongside Alicia Masters meet with [[Doc Samson]] at Camp Hammond as part of a support group. While noting the hostilities of Red Nine, Annex, Geiger, [[Batwing (Marvel Comics)|Batwing]], and [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] over the shooting of Crusader, Delroy states that he is leaving the Initiative and joining up with [[Ryder (comics)|Ryder]] to hunt down any Skrulls still hiding out on Earth. Taskmaster confronts Mutant Zero and discovers that she is really [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]]. The Gauntlet takes control as head of Camp Hammond because his position as the highest-ranking officer left. Despite an offer by the Gauntlet, Hank Pym chooses to leave the camp, because he \"was never here\".<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #20\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>\n\nNext some of the latest recruits graduated and were assigned to different teams. Batwing became a member of the Shadow Initiative, Melee was assigned to additional training to become a Camp Hammond instructor for martial arts, Annex became a member of the Mavericks (New Mexico) and Red Nine of The Cavalry, Georgia. Geiger also graduated, but it was not mentioned where she was to be stationed. Camp Hammond instructor Stingray became the new leader of the Point Men (Hawaii). Because of their villainous past Sunstreak and Prodigy were not assigned to an Initiative State Team yet, but have to remain under training at Camp Hammond. Since Gorilla Girl felt she was typical cannon fodder she decided to go home and be listed as a reserve member.\n\nMeanwhile, Baron von Blitzschlag encountered the Thor-clone (now dubbed Ragnarok), which was reactivated by a failsafe programmed by the Hank Pym Skrull, which required his access code to keep him contained. The clone apparently killed the Baron within a couple of minutes. Thereafter, Ragnarok was attacked by Thor-Girl who he beat after a long and heavy fight above Camp Hammond. Even a trick of Trauma (posing as the real Thor) was ineffective. Outside Gorilla Girl, on her way back home, got out of her car and opposed Ragnarok. As she was about to lose the fight a light appeared. The former New Warriors (now called [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]]) appeared, ready to fight.<ref name=\"ATI21\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref>\n\nThe fight with the Thor clone rages on as Justice tells Ragnarok that he had worked with the REAL Thor and that Ragnarok is unworthy of that name. After Ragnarok knocks out [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] and [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], [[Debrii]] has the Scarlet Spiders hack into Ragnarok. However, Ragnarok kills Michael the Scarlet Spider. Ragnarok is about to vanquish Von Blitzschlag with pure physical force, when the crafty Baron dismisses the notion as futile. He states that while he could easily kill everyone here and everyone in the world, he would not change the fact he is, in fact, an android-clone based on the real Thor. Unconvinced, Ragnarok is shown proof that such methods are possible when one of the Scarlet Spiders reveals he and his \"brothers\" are all clones as well. Blitzschlag tells Ragnarok that the real Thor is living in Asgard, which is now physically in the realm of Earth (or Midgard) where it is floating above Oklahoma. Ragnarok resolves that it matters not whether he is or isn't a clone, but rather that his warrior's resolve is true. He flies off to presumably confront Thor and his fellow [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref>\n\nFollowing Ragnarok's attack, Counter Force decides to bury Michael Van Patrick's body and confess to the world about Michael's death and the clones. This gives Norman Osborn the opportunity to shut down Camp Hammond.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23</ref>\n\nFollowing the Taskmaster's fight with Hardball's HYDRA faction, Norman Osborn hires him to help run the camp.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24</ref>\n\nNorman Osborn announces to the media that he has reopened the Initiative training camp under the name [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]] in New Mexico away from any populated areas. Osborn then begins to mould the Initiative to match his own vision. He transfers [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] to the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] with [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] taking his place as leader of the Heavy Hitters. He assigns the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]] to Oregon, the [[U-Foes]] to North Carolina, the [[Psionex]] to Maryland and the Women Warriors to Delaware. [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]], brainwashed at Osborn's command, is sent to Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. to assist Taskmaster. Gauntlet and Tigra leave their posts at the Initiative and join with the New Warriors to form the Avengers Resistance against Norman Osborn's new regime.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref> Trauma is kept on as the Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. counselor, against his will with the promise that if he leaves his mother will be killed, but if he stays they will cure her insanity. It is later revealed that he is actually the son of [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], who corrupts his son's body and attacks the base. Most of the heroes are stunned by their fears, but Taskmaster revives a fallen Penance, who has regained all his memories and no longer has any fears and regrets. Immune to Nightmare, he frees Trauma and Nightmare is banished.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' # 30</ref>\n\nOsborn is pleased with Taskmaster and invites him to join the Cabal, while Constrictor is shocked to learn Diamondback is a double agent to the Avengers Resistance. He admits that he doesn't care since he is in love with her. Osborn reveals to Taskmaster that the next mission will be to lay [[Siege (comics)|Siege on Asgard]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' Issues 31-35</ref> After Osborn's treachery is exposed, the Superhuman Registration Act has been abolished.<ref>''Siege'' #4</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the Initiative teams have gotten back together where their representatives meet with Prodigy in Washington DC to talk about the hammers that the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] has brought to Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt'' #1</ref>\n\n==Shadow Initiative==\n{{Infobox comics organization\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|name=Shadow Initiative\n|image=Shadow Initiative.jpg\n|imagesize=\n|caption=Cover art for ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5 featuring the Shadow Initiative, and Hulk.<br>Art by [[Jim Cheung]].\n|publisher=Marvel Comics\n|debut=''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4\n|creators=\n|base=[[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]\n|members=See [[List of characters in Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|List of Shadow Initiative members]]\n|cat=teams\n|subcat=Marvel Comics\n|hero=y\n|villain=\n|sortkey=Avengers: The Initiative\n}}\n\nIt has been revealed that there is a special \"black ops\" team within the Initiative, answerable only to Henry Gyrich and known as the Shadow Initiative.

The black ops group successfully rescues these captured trainees, while [[Trauma (comics)#Terrence Ward|Trauma]], their \"secret weapon\" tries to use his powers to scare the Hulk (becoming, in turn, the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Brian Banner]], and Bruce Banner).

Trauma is later seen recuperating in the Initiative's medical bay.\n\nIt is later revealed that the Scarlet Spiders are clones of Michael Van Patrick (MVP),<ref name=\"AvengInit#7\"/> a deceased initiative recruit accidentally killed.<ref name=\"ati_1\">{{Cite comic |writer= [[Dan Slott]] |penciller= Stefano Caselli | Inker = Stefano Caselli | Story = Happy Accidents  | Title = ''Avengers: The Initiative'' | Volume =  | Issue = #1 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref> The Scarlet Spiders are later taken off the Black Ops team after revealing themselves to the public and placed with the other trainees.<ref name=\"AvengInit#8\"/>\n\nGyrich called them to protect him from K.I.A., but they lost and one of the Scarlet Spiders was killed, and Constrictor was badly maimed. Mutant Zero saved Gyrich and Scarlet Spiders continued the battle for their brother.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10</ref> After KIA was defeated, the two remaining Scarlet Spiders left the Initiative to join [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]], a team of former New Warriors led by Justice, while Constrictor was healed with two bionic hands.\n\nDuring [[Secret Invasion]], the Shadow Initiative stayed at Camp Hammond while most others at Camp Hammond went to fight the Skrulls in New York. Later the Skrulls used Camp Hammond as a base, which [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]], discovers, having stayed behind out of cowardice. The Shadow Initiative tries to assassinate the Skrull Queen [[Veranke]], but is defeated and captured, except for Ant-Man. During this story it was revealed Mutant Zero is a red haired woman.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #17\"/>\n\nAfter Secret Invasion, [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] is added by Gauntlet to the Black-Ops team as their field leader. The Shadow Initiative, joined by Komodo, is assigned to take down a HYDRA cell, led by former Initiative member Hardball, in [[Madripoor]]. After the mission briefing, Taskmaster senses something familiar about Mutant Zero and later confronts her. A fight ensues and Taskmaster goads Mutant Zero into revealing her true identity: [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Mary Walker]].<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #20\"/>\n\nThe Shadow Initiative are dropped into Madripoor by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. During the mission, Taskmaster, Constrictor, Bengal, Typhoid Mary and Komodo are confronted by Hardball, Scorpion and HYDRA agents. Komodo is shot with HYDRA modified S.P.I.N technology by Hardball, forcing the Shadow Initiative into a hasty retreat. They manage to escape, but are forced to leave a depowered Komodo behind. Taskmaster decides to call off the mission in the light of HYDRA gaining S.P.I.N Tech. But before they can pull out of Madripoor, the Shadow Initiative learn that S.H.I.E.L.D. has since become defunct, leaving the team alone with no way out the country. They then infiltrate HYDRA, send a wire for help, and continue their mission to capture Hardball and shutdown the HYDRA cell. During the fight, Typhoid Mary relapses into her dangerous personality and escapes, leaving the rest of the Shadow Initiative in trouble. But then help arrives in the form of Ant-Man and H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. Hardball then surrenders himself to Constrictor, citing that everything that he has done was to protect Komodo. Constrictor understands, given his similar relationship with his daughter, and arrests Hardball.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24</ref>\n\nBatwing graduates from the Initiative programme and is assigned to the Shadow Initiative.<ref name=\"ATI21\"/>\n\n===Dark Reign===\n[[Butterball (Emery Schaub)|Butterball]], [[Ringer (comics)#Keith Kraft|Ringer]], Doctor Sax, Johnny Guitar, Badd Axe, Firearms, Slaughter Boy and [[Heavy Mettle]] ([[Barracuda (comics)#Heavy Mettle|Barracuda]], [[Blackwing (character)|Blackwing]], [[Riot (comics)#Second Riot|Riot]], Stronghold and Warbow) join Bengal, Komodo and Batwing in a new look Shadow Initiative.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #26\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref> But as [[Norman Osborn]] already has a covert team in the shape of the Thunderbolts, the Shadow Initiative is turned into a \"cannon fodder\" unit, purposely sent on suicide missions, a fact that is hidden from the Shadow Initiative members.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #27\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27</ref>\n\nBefore their first mission to take back Prison 42 from Blastaar's alien forces, Johnny Guitar overhears the Taskmaster and learns the Shadow Initiative's true purpose. After some consideration, he bravely goes through with the mission. But not before guaranteeing his family's compensation in the event of his death and deliberately injuring his best friend Doctor Sax, washing him out of the Initiative and in turn saving his life. During the siege to take back Prison 42 along with several other members of the Shadow Initiative, Johnny Guitar is killed in action. Also confirmed to be killed are Blackwing, Slaughterboy, and Firearms. Bengal, Komodo, Batwing, Butterball and the surviving members of the Shadow Initiative fight against the odds and manage to take back prison 42. They are aided by Hardball, a Prison 42 detainee forced to join Blastaar's army, who suggests to [[Gorilla-Man#Arthur Nagan|Dr. Arthur Nagan]] that they should release Dragon Man, knowing that the creature would side with Komodo. Taskmaster, Constrictor, Penance, Living Laser and Scorcher arrive shortly after to finish off the enemy. Bengal and the rest of the Shadow Initiative become painfully aware of the true nature of their mission.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Initiative #27\"/>\n\nOsborn orders members of the Shadow Initiative (Badd Axe, Ringer, and Warbow) to attack the [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] after they secede from the Initiative. They help the other Initiative teams to defeat and capture the Heavy Hitters' leader, [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]].

A [[t-shirt]] with some kind of logo (often with the first letter of the cadet's codename) on it is provided if the cadet does not already have a costume. If the cadet has a secret identity they are required to somehow conceal their identity (i.e. a mask, goggles, a helmet, shape-changing or some form of concealment).\n* While the \"Avengers Assemble!\" battle cry is used by instructors and cadets in battle and many instructors and cadets are former or current members, being a recruit does not automatically award one membership in the Avengers. Use of the Avengers name is an informal one meant to act as an inspirational tool.\n\n==Collected editions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title !! Material collected !! Publication date !!
