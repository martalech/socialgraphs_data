Rosalie is picked up by Ray Nadeem and [[Bullseye (Marvel Comics)|Benjamin Poindexter]] at a groundbreaking opening ceremony as Ray tells her to come quietly. She is taken along with four criminal figures John Hammer, Everett Starr, Latimer Zyl, and Sophia Carter to a fancy restaurant in Hell's Kitchen called the Red Fish Blue Restaurant where they're seated around a circular table for several hours. Rosalie was shown to be on good terms with Zyl. Fisk then shows up and offers the five criminal figures protection from prosecution in exchange for 20% of their profits. When Starr refuses the offer, Dex kills him by lobbing a baton at his forehead. Fisk uses this as an incentive to hike the tax to 25%, which Rosalie and the other crime lords hastily agree to. In the season 3 finale, Rosalie is later seen as one of the many criminal figures and socialites in attendance at Fisk and [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Mariana]]'s wedding. She comments to Fisk about him sitting her next to the prosecutor that tried to send her to prison and stated that she made him hold her purse.

Wheatley]]. He was exclusively referred to in the solicitations as '''\"Bible John\"''', and the use of that nickname was established in the first issue. However, that name was rarely used in other issues. He is one of the last of an order of warrior/scholars named the Cathari, who all take vows to combat the evil forces of the [[supernatural]]. Carik appeared in all issues of ''Blade: The Vampire Hunter'' (July 1994 to April 1995) except Issue #6. The series was cancelled after ten issues leaving John Carik's story unfinished. Carik was attacked by a supernatural being of an undisclosed nature, the encounter giving him [[precognition]]. He was shortly thereafter contacted by and joined the Cathari. Carik is covered from head to toe inwards and sigils that he has carved into his flesh which gives him protection from supernatural beings.\n\nBlade: the Vampire Hunter begins with Carik having a vision of the return of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and the resulting destruction of [[New York City]]. His vision gives him the knowledge that Blade is the only one who can prevent the events from coming true. In order to warn Blade, Carik escapes from the Nyman Psychiatric Clinic and seeks him out. Once he finds Blade, Carik gives him a witch compass, a device for seeking out the supernatural.\n\n===John Carik in other media===\nAlthough he never made an appearance in the ''[[Blade (film series)|Blade]]'' films or in ''[[Blade: The Series]]'', many of John Carik's character traits are visible in [[Abraham Whistler]]'s character. He was originally intended to appear in ''[[Blade: The Series]]'' (portrayed by [[Marc Singer]]) but was eventually scrapped.\n\n==Luke Carlyle==\nLuke Carlyle was created by [[J.

He was finally defeated by a combined effort between Octavius and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #47</ref>\n\n===Luke Carlyle in other media===\nLuke Carlyle, under the alias of '''The Mad Bomber''', appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. The Mad Bomber is the only villain to be featured across all platforms, besides the three antagonists of the film itself. His public persona is that of a respectable businessman, who secretly uses his wealth to provide for his gang, the '''H-Bombers''', equipment, and weaponry. As their name suggests, the gang's main goal is to destroy New York using explosives, though their motivation remains unknown and their plans are constantly thwarted by Spider-Man. The game's H-Bombers storyline culminates with an attack on the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', during which it is revealed that Carlyle has a vendetta against [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who published a story that exposed Carlyle's company as environmentally damaging, driving him out of business and leading him to create his gang. After Spider-Man thwarts the H-Bombers' attack and rescues Jameson, Carlyle either escapes (in the next-gen version), or is defeated and arrested (in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], and [[Wii]] versions). The [[Game Boy Advance]] version of the game differs drastically from the others. Here, The Mad Bomber doesn't lead the H-Bombers but instead plants several bombs across the city by himself. He is foiled by Spider-Man, who defeats him and hands him over to the police.\n\n==Carnage==\n{{main|Carnage (character)}}\n\n==Carnivore==\n{{main|Carnivore (comics)}}\n\n==Bruno Carrelli==\n{{expand section|date=July 2022}}\n'''Bruno Carrelli''' is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nBruno Carrelli is an intelligent friend of [[Kamala Khan]].<ref>''All-New Marvel NOW!

He possessed all their memories and instinctively used the knowledge he needed. Therefore, he was an expert on many topics and a very skilled fighter, especially with his battle-staff, Parallax. His lifespan was apparently fixed at 100 years. He was sometimes seen [[Levitation|levitating]] while in a deep meditative [[trance]]. He had a symbiotic rapport with Parallax, an entity which bound the multiple personalities of Century into a unified self.\n\nSince developing [[amnesia]], Century couldn't remember much about his past and often had to search for the right words which led to Century sounding like a [[thesaurus]] when he often used three similar words to express himself. Single memories returned when he was confronted with something from his past or he dreamt about it. After losing Parallax for a while, memories of his composite minds loosened and even after Parallax was returned to him he continued to remember bits from the lives of the Hodomur he was composed of.\n\nTo defeat the evil Nexus Being named Lore, responsible for the destruction of their world, the Hodomur race created Century, a being composed of the best 100 surviving Hodomur warriors. Possessing all of their memories, he was able to solve situations in many topics. He started a mission to track down Lore, but during inter-dimensional travel, he was enslaved by Broker and brainwashed. Only the urge to find Lore was maintained on his mind. He soon became a \"scout\" for the evil alien race of the Scatter, which bought him from Broket. Following constantly Century, the Scatter could feast on the leftovers of the worlds destroyed by Lore. Century first encountered the superhero team [[Force Works]] when Scarlet Witch's magic brought the alien on Earth-616 following a battle against the [[Kree]]. Century knocked out Kalum Lo, then when questioned by Scarlet about his whereabouts, was able to say only his name. A few minutes later Scarlet Witch, Spider-Woman, and U.S.Agent were all captured by the Scatter, that arriving on Earth the following Century, and also caused Wonder Man's apparent death. [[Iron Man]] questioned Century about the Scatter's whereabouts but Century knew only the name of their race and their evil goals, causing Stark to leave him behind. He was next to be brought to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] but escaped and teleported to Iron Man. Using the teleportation powers of his staff Parallax, Century helped Iron Man to rescue the team from an unknown world ravaged by the Scatter. He helped Force Works defeat these aliens. Getting quarter to the Works, he soon joined the team on a full basis participating in missions to Slorenia, China, Australia, and defeating the menace of the Starstealth once and for at all. During a brief travel to space aboard the ship of ''Broker'', he was captured by the foe and sold to the mysterious ''Imogen''. He was then freed by ''Azimuth'', that was next to reveal the truth on his origins and life, but she was stricken by an energy blast of Imogen and fell comatose. After killing Broker for good, he returned to Earth, rejoining Force Works in time to help them unravel the plot of Kang (Immortus in disguise) that had on his side a corrupted Iron Man and Cybermancer, alternate version of scientist Suzi Endo. After Stark sacrificed himself to prevent Kang's plans, Force Works had to endure a last fight against alternate universe versions of [[Wonder Man]], and [[Ultron]], belonging to Cybermancer's reality. Force Works managed to resolve this situation. Before the team was disbanded, Century expressed the desire to learn more about his new homeworld, Earth. Force Works then responded to an emergency call starting for a final mission whose result remained unknown.\n\nCentury is later recruited by [[Wonder Man]] (whose ionic energy leaking problem was affecting his judgement) to join his [[Revengers]] in a plot to defeat the Avengers. He was easily defeated by the New Avengers.<ref>''The New Avengers Annual'' vol. 2 #1</ref> While incarcerated at the Raft, Century and the rest of Wonder Man's followers were interrogated about their motivations for joining the Revengers. Century stated that he sided with Wonder Man out of sense of honor to him and recognition of the cycle of life.<ref>''The Avengers Annual'' vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\nAs his name and some of his history indicated, Century was meant to be the best of the 100 beings that made him up.\n\nHe was shown to have greater than human strength, agility, and endurance. Additionally, by using Parallax, he was able to [[Teleportation|teleport]] through inter-dimensional space. He's also an expert hand-to-hand combatant.\n\n===Century in other media===\n* Century ''appears in [[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'', voiced by [[James Warwick (actor)|James Warwick]] in season one, [[Jim Cummings]] in \"The Beast Within\", and by [[Tom Kane]] in the two-part series finale. A scene in the episode \"Data In, Chaos Out\" gives Century a civilian identity as a man named Woody where he sports shades and a broad-brimmed hat. In \"The Beast Within,\" Century was the one who told Iron Man that the Force Works team is relocating from Stark Industries following Iron Man's team-up with the Mandarin to stop [[Fin Fang Foom]]. In the two-part episode \"Hands of the Mandarin,\" Century rejoins Force Works when Mandarin uses the Heart of Darkness crystal to disable all technology. He appeared to knock out Hypnotia when she was using her powers on Iron Man and War Machine.\n\n==Cerebra==\n{{main|Cerebra}}\n\n==Cerise==\n{{main|Cerise (comics)}}\n\n==Chaka== <!-- [[Chaka (comics)]] redirects here -->\n{{Comics character list header\n|name= Chaka Khan\n|Marvelwiki= \n|CBDBid= \n|GCDid= \n}}\n'''Chaka''' was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and first appeared in ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] #8'' in October 1976.\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Chaka (Robert Hao) learns martial arts from his older brother William.

However, the battle is interrupted by the [[Raymond Warren (comics)|Jackal]], who steals Herman and Clayton's technology. After the two help Spider-Man defeat the Jackal, the former brings them back to the Osborn Academy to face up to their actions.

Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson's vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of [[Landau, Luckman & Lake]] who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson's eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had terminal illness, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms-dealer [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]].\n\nUnder his orders, Copycat infiltrated [[X-Force]] in the shape of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] while the real Domino was a prisoner. Her mission was to blow up X-Force's headquarters in order to kill [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but she became attached to the team members, fell in love with Cable and didn't go through with her mission. Tolliver sent Deadpool to force her to set the bomb. Deadpool would be put in her place, if she refused. Deadpool revealed Copycat's cover to X-Force, and left them for dead by blowing up the complex (without knowing that X-Force had already escaped).\n\nVanessa briefly hid herself under the false identity (as a twin) of one of her friends; Tina Valentino. Deadpool and his associate, Sluggo, believing they killed her, killed Tina instead. She then moved in with [[Garrison Kane]] in [[San Francisco]], until Cable found them.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Cable|Issue = 37|Date = Nov. 1996|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> She was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating [[Psycho-Man]], who sought Kane's advanced technology, but was rescued from the [[Microverse]] by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse's resident heroes, the Microns. Later, she broke up with Kane and came back to live with Deadpool. Deadpool's feelings towards [[Siryn]] grew, so she left him after having taken his appearance to attack her, in hopes of souring their potential relationship.\n\nSome time later, Copycat was captured by [[Weapon X]]. The treatments of Weapon X destroyed her memory and she forgot her mission. Recruited by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], Deadpool received an order to kill her. He tried to warn her, so Weapon X sent Kane to kill the both of them. The fight took them to a local zoo where Deadpool left her in a shapechanged-gorilla form among other gorillas to fight against Kane. When he returned, the other gorillas were dead and Copycat was dying from wounds inflicted by Sabretooth. She died shortly after in Deadpool's arms.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 1|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Deadpool had poured an amount of his blood into Copycat's wounds, which, unknown to him, healed her. Vanessa then took up the identity of an owner of a chimichanga stand, and later cheated Deadpool out of one of his past marriages.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 3|Issue = 27|Date = 2014|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nCopycat is such a powerful and precise [[shapeshifting|metamorph]] that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level. Because of this, she is able to replicate superhuman powers, abilities, and even mental imprints so closely that telepaths have trouble identifying her. Copycat simply requires knowledge to duplicate someone's appearance, but needs physical contact to duplicate anything else. She is also capable of turning into animals, finding these forms easier to maintain than human shape.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 1|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Weapon X modified her powers by accelerating the rate at which she could duplicate others. However, as a side effect of this enhancement, Copycat began to lose her memory and was unable to hold any solid form for long periods of time.\n\n===Other versions of Copycat===\n\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Copycat was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the [[Multiple Man|Madri]]. She served alongside other members such as [[Madison Jeffries]] and [[Spyne]]. She was often referred to as Sister Vanessa or Sister Carlysle. Using her shape-shifting powers, Copycat was able to hide incognito amongst the humans who had hoped to flee North America and was able to discover the site of the Sentinel Evacuation while in their midst. Vanessa led the Brotherhood to an emigration site in Maine and there they clashed with the Amazing X-Men. In an attempt to elude the X-Man Quicksilver, Copycat posed as Scarlet Witch, but was forced to revert to her normal self by Dazzler. Both Copycat and Box were able to escape the X-Men and conceal themselves, posing as humans, and escaped to Europe. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for a group of Altered Humans to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey, with the latter slaying Vanessa in the process.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Weapon X|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = Apr. 1995|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Copycat infiltrated Cannonball's X-Force when she worked for the Human Coalition.

Though she sports a telltale streak of white hair and references are made to the \"roles\" she has played, Vanessa has not demonstrated any mutant powers as of yet that relate to her comic-book counterpart. This is due to writers [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]] deciding the reveal would be too confusing, although they have expressed interest in exploring the idea in a future story.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Eric|title=Deadpool Decided Not To Turn This Character Into A Mutant, Here's Why|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Deadpool-Decided-Turn-Character-Mutant-Here-Why-112447.html|website=Cinema Blend|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> She is in a relationship with and got engaged to [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]], later learning of his cancer. Following his transformation into Deadpool and disfigurement in an attempt to cure his cancee however, he left her without a word. While working at a [[strip club]], Vanessa is abducted by [[Francis Fanny|Ajax]] and [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]] to lure out Deadpool. After he rescued her, Vanessa was initially angry with Deadpool for abandoning her, though she reconciled with him upon learning of his plight.\n* Vanessa appears in the live-action sequel film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', with Morena Baccarin reprising her role. Vanessa and Wade celebrate their anniversary and discuss starting a family. However, a drug lord he failed to kill earlier kills her. Following this, Vanessa later appears as a vision in the afterlife to tell a devastated Wade that he must protect [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins]] from [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. After Deadpool sacrifices himself to save Russell, he and Vanessa are temporarily reunited, but she tells him it is not his time yet and sends him back. In a mid-credits scene, Deadpool uses Cable's time-travel device to avert Vanessa's death.\n\n==Anya Corazon==\n{{main|Anya Corazon}}\n\n==Gil Corazon==\n'''Gilberto \"Gil\" Corazon''' is a minor character in [[Marvel Comics]].

The robot initially had a fully feminine human appearance, and was referred to as \"she\" by its creators to the point that Jaxon himself was unaware of \"her\" true nature.<ref name=\"AF12\">''Alpha Flight'' #12 (July 1984)</ref> Courtney acted on Jaxon's behalf to recruit several superhumans that were former members of [[Gamma Flight]] and [[Beta Flight]] (the [[Canada|Canadian]] government's training teams) that were dismissed after the government closed [[Department H]], the division that oversaw Gamma, Beta, and the primary [[Alpha Flight]] team.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #7 (Feb. 1984)</ref> Jaxon intended to form a personal [[Omega Flight|super-team]] in order to revenge on James MacDonald Hudson, founder of Department H and leader of the still-active Alpha Flight as [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], and Courtney was able to manipulate the already-disenfranchised recruits into seeking their own revenge on Alpha through an \"influencer\" device built into its systems.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #11 (June 1984)</ref> However, Courtney was unable to influence Roger Bochs (inventor of the [[Box (comics)|Box]] robot) who was still loyal to Hudson and the Flight program, forcing Jaxon to directly involve himself by taking control of Box.<ref name=\"AF12\"/>\n\nLuring James and [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]] to America with an offer of employment at Roxxon's [[New York City]] holdings, Jaxon and Omega Flight executed an ambush of Guardian while Heather was detained by Courtney. When Heather made an attempt to escape and scuffled with Courtney, the robot's flesh-like facial covering was damaged and its true nature revealed. While Omega Flight's goal of revenge was attained with Guardian's apparent death, Courtney was witness to Jaxon's own death due to feedback from Box's destruction,<ref name=\"AF12\"/> and Omega's remaining members were turned over to the New York City authorities.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #13 (Aug. 1984)</ref>\n\nEscaping capture, Courtney freed Omega Flight from jail and employed the group in a new plot against Alpha Flight. Having its appearance reconfigured and incorporating facsimiles of Guardian's battle-suit technology into its systems, Courtney infiltrated Alpha Flight posing as Guardian and eventually lured the group into a second encounter with Omega Flight, using Alpha's trust of \"Guardian\" to ambush.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25\u201327 (Aug.\u2013Oct. 1985)</ref> However, Omega Flight's victory was foiled by the [[Beyonder]]'s arrival,<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #4 (Oct. 1985)</ref> and Courtney and its team were forced to flee.\n\nTheir escape was blocked by [[Madison Jeffries]], a former Flight trainee whom Courtney had avoided recruiting, fearing his ability to control machines and his loyalty to James. When Jeffries attacked with a construct created from an automobile, Courtney used one of the future duplicates of Omega Flight member [[Flashback (comics)|Flashback]] as a human shield, resulting in its death (and the mental breakdown of the original Flashback, now condemned to violent death in his future). This enraged Jeffries, who used his powers to destroy Courtney, forcing its internal circuitry out of its mouth.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28 (Nov. 1985)</ref>\n\nBochs and Jeffries later salvaged portions of Courtney's second incarnation to construct a new battle-suit functionally identical to James's original,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #31 (Feb. 1986)</ref> which was used by Heather under the Vindicator identity.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #32 (March 1986)</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nDelphine Courtney possessed superhuman strength, and had a high degree of resistance to physical damage. Its sight and hearing were sharper than a human being's. It also possessed a device called an \"influencer\" that could affect pre-existing psychological conditions in the human mind, allowing Courtney to manipulate individuals with judicious use of the influencer combined with verbal interaction; however, it could not absolutely control human beings, as Roger Bochs' loyalty to James Hudson allowed him to resist its manipulations.
