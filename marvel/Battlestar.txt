In ''Captain America'' #327 he is called \"Lemar\" for the first time, but generally is still treated as interchangeable with the other BUCs. He rises from anonymity in ''Captain America'' #334, in which his full name is revealed and he adopts the identity of Bucky. Gruenwald later explained:\n\n{{quote|I get several letters every month asking when Bucky's coming back. And I said, \"Well, if the government's getting a new Captain America, maybe they'd want to get a new Bucky.\" I had previously introduced three Buckies as the friends and partners of [[U.S. Agent (comics)|the Super-Patriot]], the Bold Urban Commandos, and rather than create someone new, I decided one of them would be ''the'' Bucky. There were two white guys and a black guy, and I said why not the black guy. He at least stood out in the group. Cap had a black partner before in the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but he's had three other white partners so I said it's time for another black one. Thus, Bucky was black. Now I'm getting a lot of bad mail, and deservedly so, for my ignorance.<ref name=\"DAK54\">{{Cite news |last=Zimmerman |first=Dwight Jon |date=January 1988 |title=Mark Gruenwald |pages=5\u201323 |work=[[Comics Interview]] |publisher=[[Fictioneer Books]] |issue=54}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nWriter [[Dwayne McDuffie]] informed Gruenwald that \"Buck\" is considered a derogatory term among African-Americans, as it was a term used before the [[American Civil War]] to refer to male slaves, and said that it was also racially offensive to have an adult black man taking on the identity of a teenage sidekick.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 15, 2018 |title=Comic Legends: How Dwayne McDuffie Saved Captain America From Racism |url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-dwayne-mcduffie-racism/ |access-date=November 29, 2019 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>  Writer Mark Gruenwald had not known of the racial connotation of \"Bucky\", having grown up in a region with very few African-Americans,<ref name=\"DAK54\" /> and worked with McDuffie to create a story to address the problem and give Hoskins a new name.\n\nIn ''Captain America'' #341 he is renamed Battlestar, dons his own unique costume, and is more explicitly presented as a partner to the new Captain America, rather than a sidekick.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=45}}</ref> Gruenwald recalled, \"The search for a good name for a partner to Cap is a whole half-hour unto itself.
