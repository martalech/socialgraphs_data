First created by [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] and [[Chris Bachalo]], the Children of the Vault debuted in [[X-Men (comic book)|X-Men]] volume 2, #188 (September 2006). They are primarily antagonists of the [[X-Men]].\n\nThe Children of the Vault were raised in the closed vault aboard a cargo ship, where temporal acceleration technology was used to evolve individuals into super-powered beings. Due to [[genetic drift]], they are a separate species from both baseline humans and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Their goal is to exterminate both humans and mutants in order to take over the Earth. \n\n==Fictional team biography==\n===Supernovas===\nThe Children of the Vault first appear In the X-Men arc \"Supernovas,\" as super-powered beings who aim to exterminate both mutants and baseline humans, in order to claim Earth for themselves. While pursuing [[Sabretooth (character)|Sabretooth]], two of the Children, Sangre and Serafina, use a \"singularity generator\" to destroy a town in [[Nogales Municipality, Veracruz|Nogales, Mexico]], framing the X-Men for the disaster. Two others, Aguja and Fuego ambush Sabretooth, who escapes and seeks help from the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' Volume 2, Issue 188</ref> All four Children of the Vault next kill all of the members of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility where [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] has been held captive and take him, and later [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], in order to kill Sabretooth.<ref>''X-Men'', Volume 2, Issue 189</ref> Serafina doctors mages of the X-Men into the security footage, further discrediting the team. They also enhance the powers of the twins, Aurora and Northstar, so that they now produce a powerful heat blast when touching.\n\nAfter sending an enhanced Northstar and Aurora to kill Sabretooth and the X-Men, Serafina watches from a distance with another one of the Children, Perro. The surprise attack is initially successful, causing the apparent death of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and severe injuries to many of the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'', Volume 2, Issue 189</ref> Luckily, Aurora is defeated thanks to [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique's]] manipulation and Iceman's surprise (though incomplete) reformation, and Northstar is defeated by the combined efforts of [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].\n\nFollowing the fight, Sabretooth informs Cable that their enemies are known as \"The Children of the Vault.\"  They are neither humans nor mutants, but a new species, evolutionarily distinct from either branch, created by a scientist and then cycled through normal evolutionary processes over the course of 6,000 years inside a time-accelerated cargo ship off the coast of [[Peru]]. Their cargo ship, the Conquistador, was designed to stay sealed until the planet was empty for the Children to take over. However, the energy discharge from the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] caused their vault to open early. Sabretooth also reveals that he was hired by one of the scientists to kill everyone involved in their creation. \n\nMeanwhile, Serafina uses her cloaking abilities to infiltrate the [[X-Mansion|mansion]] directly. She is invisible to telepaths, and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is only mildly aware that something is amiss. She easily makes her way to the injured [[Lady Mastermind]] in the infirmary, and hijacks her abilities in order to trap [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] in an illusion. Wolverine manages to free Cannonball; however, Serafina subdues both mutants. \n\nSerafina then rejoins her team, en route to New York. Rogue and her team, now including Lady Mastermind, Sabretooth, and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]], track and board the Children's ship. However, in the ensuing fight, the X-Men are overwhelmed, with Iceman essentially vaporized by Fuego, as the Conquistador hovers over the Xavier Institute, ready to destroy all the mutants within.\n\nThe X-Men fight back, though, destroying the weapons that would have destroyed the school, and killing several of the Children of the Vault, including Sangre, Aguja, and Fuego.  With his last breath, Sangre tries to crash the Conquistador into the school, but it is stopped at the last minute by Cannonball and the [[Sentinel (comics)|ONE Sentinels]].  Many of the Children of the Vault (including Perro) manage to escape the battle alive, leaving behind animal carcasses altered to resemble them. The survivors, led by the mysterious Cadena, are revealed to have escaped to Ecuador, to the abandoned Sentinel facility once used by [[Cassandra Nova]].<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/blogs/Agent_M/entry/557 Marvel.com Blogs - Spy in the House by Agent M<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe X-Men continue to use the captured Conquistador as a flying base of operations for some time. \n\n===Collision===\nThe X-Men next encounter the Children of the Vault in [[Mumbai]]. A rebellious young member of the Children, Luz, escapes from the group's new headquarters, the futuristic city \"The Corridor\" (also known as Quitado), and lands in Mumbai during what appears to be a magnetic storm. She immediately encounters the X-Men Rogue, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], and [[Anole (character)|Anole]], who along with their teammate [[Indra (comics)|Indra]], are visiting Indra's family nearby. Luz claims to be a local girl named Luisa. When \"Luisa\" demonstrates her ability to paint colors in the air via light manipulation, Rogue, suspecting her to be a mutant, offers her hospitality at Indra's family's home. The remaining Children, led by a woman named Corregidora, pursue Luz, whom they believe to be critical to something called \"Angelfire.\" Eventually, a team of Children, including Serafina, Cadena, and Perro, attack Indra's family home.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #239</ref> The Children defeat the X-Men easily, and only spare their lives when Luz offers to return with them. The Children take Luz, Rogue, and Magneto with them back to the Corridor, located, according to Cadena \"in the void between dimensions.\" There, Magneto learns that the magnetic storms menacing Mumbai are a waste byproduct of the Corridor's power grid. Angelfire, Cadena explains, is a new, cleaner engine, to be powered by \"the 30,\" a group of Children including Luz -- and the captured Magneto. Cadena and her team prepare to initiate Angelfire. Meanwhile, Corregidora and Perro officiate over Rogue's public execution in the \"Sensorium,\" a psychic link among all the Children. Angelfire fails spectacularly because Luz has traded places with Indra's human fiancee, Vaipala. The Corridor crashes into Mumbai.<ref>X-Men Legacy Issue #240</ref> Rogue and Magneto escape from Quitado, with help from Luz, Anole, Indra, and Loa, and send Quitado back into the void between dimensions. Magneto predicts that the Children will be unable to find their way back to Earth.<ref>X-Men Legacy Issue #241</ref>\n\n===Dawn of X===\nThe Children of the Vault reappear during the [[Dawn of X]] era of X-Men comics. Serafina is rescued from captivity by the X-Men, during a raid on a base of the X-Men's enemy Orchis.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 5) #1</ref> Later, [[Darwin (character)|Darwin]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]], and [[X-23]] are tasked with infiltrating the Children's base of operations in Ecuador. The Children of the Vault are also revealed to be the earliest members of the Post-Humans, better known as Homo novissima, a race destined to depose both [[Human|Homo sapiens]] and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Homo superior]] as the dominant species on Earth.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 5) #5</ref> \n\nOnce inside the Vault, the trio battle against the Children of the Vault with X-23 seemingly killing Serafina and Fuego and Synch killing Sangre and Perro by using Fuego's powers. In retaliation, Aguja unleashes a massive force field in an attempt to kill her foes, killing herself in the process.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 5) #18</ref> The trio survive the attack and gather intelligence for the next 100 years. They learn that at the heart of the Vault lies the City, a supercomputer that has become self-aware and eventually has expressed a desire to expand beyond the Vault, therefore creating in the process the Children of the Vault. After Serafina's capture and escape from Orchis and the rise of the nation of Krakoa, the City has created the third generation of the Children so they can eventually take over Earth. Darwin, X-23, and Synch also learn that any Children who have died are resurrected by the City through cloning to further the evolution process. The City soon becomes interested in Darwin's adaptation power. The Children capture Darwin in order to learn more about his power. Consequently, the City is able to create a fourth generation of Children. The Children chase and are able to prevent Wolverine and Synch from escaping the Vault. Before dying, however, Synch manages to make a telepathic contact with Professor Xavier and ensure everything he's learned about the Children of the Vault is passed onto his resurrected form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 5) #19</ref>\n\n===Project Blackbox===\nLater Forge is able to created a bio-dome that was activated when the Children exited the Vault which contained not only the Children of the Vault but the entire Vault itself inside a simulated reality that they believe to be real. In this simulated reality, once the Children emerged from the vault, its revealed that they have become greatly evolved and extremely powerful. They quickly overwhelm the two mutants with Forge loosing a hand and Cyclops is killed by Fuego's flames after he absorb and redirect Cyclops' optic blast. They then travel to Krakoa which falls less than a day after the Vault opened. New York City is burning and the Avengers went down swinging. Ghost Rider is killed by Fuego.\nThe Children then kills the Fantastic Four. Sangre drowns Thing, Fuego kills Johnny, Reed is dead on the ground and Serafina snaps Sue's neck.\nEarth's mystics lasted the longest and Latveria was the last stand of mankind. Clea and Doom are killed nevertheless.\nInsatiable, the Children of the Vault journeyed to Asgard, where they killed everyone and eat a feast on top of Thor's dead body.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 6) #15</ref>\n\n==Members==\n\nThe Children of the Vault members are:\n\n'''Sangre''' (Blood): The de facto team leader, he has grey skin that is apparently made of liquid and, thanks to his advanced water manipulation abilities, can produce bubbles used to suffocate his victims, among other things.
