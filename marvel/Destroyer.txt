He returns in Thomas and Robbins' ''Invaders'' #18\u201321 (July\u2013Oct. 1977); in the story he parachutes into Nazi Germany with [[Union Jack (comics)|Lord Falsworth]] and [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] on a mission to restore his memory; a flashback reveals that he and his best friend Brian Falsworth had gone to Berlin on a peace mission which ended with them in a Nazi prison where he was experimented on.\n\nThomas and Robbins also featured the Falsworth incarnation of the Destroyer in ''The Invaders'' #18\u201319 (July\u2013Aug. 1977); in the story he explains how he received a variation of the super-soldier formula from a fellow inmate of a Nazi prison; the previous incarnation as Marlow is [[retroactive continuity|retconed]] as a mistaken FBI theory popularized in comic books. Thomas and Robbins concluded the plot-line in ''The Invaders'' #20\u201321 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1977); in the story he abandons his role as the Destroyer and takes over his father's role of [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] to rescue his sister and the rest of the team while Aubrey helps to steal a plane to get them home, and in ''The Invaders'' #22 (Nov. 1977); in which they are both safely returned to England. Thomas and Robbins also featured Falsworth as Union Jack in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #4 (Aug. 1977); in the story he and Spitfire save [[Winston Churchill]] from a Nazi assassination attempt.\n\nThomas and Robbins continued to feature Falsworth and Aubrey in the series, with the former becoming a semi-permanent member of the team in his new role as Union Jack with issues #23 (Dec. 1977) & #25 (Feb. 1978); in which he joins them on his first mission, while the latter appeared in a supporting role as Dyna-Mite in issue #23 (December 1977); in which he searches for a cure for the Nazi experimentation that has reduced his size, and #26 (March 1978); in which a restored Aubrey is introduced in his role as the new Destroyer. This incarnation was also featured by Thomas, Donald Glut and Alan Kupperberg in ''The Invaders'' #34 (Nov. 1978) and by Glut, Kupperberg and Charles Eber Stone in ''The Invaders'' #41 (Sept. 1979).\n\n===1980s publications===\n[[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] mentioned Falsworth in the backstory for ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #253\u2013254 (January\u2013February 1981); the story reveals in a flashback that he died in a car crash in 1953.\n\n===1990s publications===\n[[Dan Slott]] and James W. Fry III featured Aubrey in the World War II-era story ''Enis Nacht'' for ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #156 (June 1994); in the story he guides a British bomber to its Nazi target. Slott and Fry featured him in another World War II-era story for ''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'' #9 (May 1995); in the story he helps the [[Blazing Skull]] to infiltrate a Nazi base.\n\n===2000s publications===\nAubrey appears as a supporting character in [[Fabian Nicieza]] and Lewis LaRosa's ''[[V-Battalion|Citizen V and the V-Battalion: The Everlasting]]'' #1 (March 2002); the story begins with a flashback showing him at Falsworth's funeral in 1953.\n\n[[Allan Jacobsen (comics)|Allan Jacobsen]] and C.P. Smith used Aubrey as a supporting character in a number of volumes ''New Invaders'', including, #2 (Nov. 2004), in which he is claimed to be one of the new team's first recruits, #4\u20135 (January\u2013February 2005), which sees him battling the vampiric Baroness Blood alongside Union Jack; and #9 (June 2005), which sees him resuming command of V-Battalion following the death of the original Human Torch.\n\n==Fictional character biographies==\n\n===Keen Marlow===\n[[People of the United States|American]] [[journalist]] Keen Marlow is captured for spying while reporting behind-the-lines in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]]. While imprisoned in a concentration camp\u2014that specific phrase being used before its association with the [[Holocaust]]\u2014Marlow is given a super-soldier serum, similar to that given to [[Captain America]], by fellow prisoner Professor Eric Schmitt, an anti-Nazi German [[scientist]]. Responding to the chemical (and without the beneficial \"Vita-Rays\" used to chemically stabilize Captain America's serum), Marlow becomes a prime human specimen who escapes, dons a sleek, dark costume with a skull motif and a skintight blue mask that made him appear inhuman, and adopts a fearsome identity with which he fights the Nazis on their own turf.<ref name=War>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Paul |title=Encyclopedia of Weird War Stories: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Film, Television, Games and Other Media |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-1476666723 |page=54}}</ref> He was occasionally abetted by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] agent named Florence von Banger. Antagonists included the Scar, Herr Sin and Von Maus.\n\n===Brian Falsworth===\n{{main article|Union Jack (comics)}}\n\nIn the Destroyer's [[retcon]] appearances in the 1970s, the same origin is recounted except for his identity. Now he is '''Brian Falsworth''', brother of [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] (a member of the [[World War II]] superhero group [[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]) and son of James Montgomery Falsworth, Lord Falsworth, who had been the [[World War I]] hero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. In this storyline, when Captain America asked if the Destroyer is or is not \"an American named Keen Marlow\", Falsworth declined to respond.\n\n===Roger Aubrey===\nBrian Falsworth gave up the Destroyer identity in order to become the new [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], and his friend [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Roger Aubrey]] (initially introduced as the superhero Dyna-Mite, a member of the team the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]]<ref>''The Invaders'' #14</ref>) became the new Destroyer. Falsworth's story is recounted in passing in [[Ed Brubaker]]'s 2009\u20132010 miniseries ''[[The Marvels Project]]'' as part of the Angel's diary of the war. This retelling claims that \"Keen Marlow\" was an alias used by Falsworth to enter Germany to spy; he was betrayed and captured, and then empowered well after Captain America.<ref>''The Marvels Project'' #7</ref> However, prior established continuity showed that Falsworth entered Germany under his real name pre-war to promote appeasement, that he was captured trying to leave Germany shortly after Poland was invaded, and empowered only days later, more than a year before Steve Rogers became Captain America.<ref>''The Invaders'' #19</ref> It was later revealed that Brian and Roger were lovers.<ref>''Citizen V and the V Battalion'' vol. 2 #1 (March 2002)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nVersions of the Destroyer, both in continuity and out, have appeared in various Marvel comics. ''The Age of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]'' #5 (March 2009) depicts the character as a member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].
