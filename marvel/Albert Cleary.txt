For example:\n\n* [[Thermal lance]] cutting around the rupture.\n* [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxyacetylene welding]] or electric [[arc welding]] of plates over the rupture.\n* Quick-drying [[cement]] is applied underwater over the rupture.\n\nDamage control training is undertaken by most seafarers, but the engineering staff are most experienced in making lasting repairs.\n\nDamage control is distinct from [[firefighting]]. Damage control methods of fighting fire are based on the class of ship and cater to ship specific equipment on board.\n\n==Notable contemporary examples==\n[[File:USS Cole (DDG-67) Departs.jpg|thumb|Damage to USS ''Cole'']]\n\nParticular examples:\n\n* [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']]: After an [[Iran]]ian [[naval mine|mine]] holed the [[frigate]] beneath the waterline in 1988, the crew fought fire and flooding that threatened to sink it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navybook.com/no-higher-honor/timeline/mine-strike/|title=Mine Strike!|date=5 February 2013}}</ref>\n* [[USS Princeton (CG-59)|USS ''Princeton]]: After an Iraqi naval mine damaged the [[cruiser]] during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], her crew fought fires and sealed cracks in the hull, then repaired electronic systems, bringing the [[Aegis combat system]] back on line within 2 hours.\n* [[USS Cole (DDG-67)|USS ''Cole'']]: immediate measures to stop sinking after the ship was [[USS Cole bombing|bombed in 2000]].\n* [[HMS Nottingham (D91)|HMS ''Nottingham'']]: measures to keep the ship afloat after, on 7 July 2002, the ''Nottingham'' ran aground on the submerged but well-charted [[Wolf Rock, Lord Howe Island|Wolf Rock]] near [[Lord Howe Island]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Naval architecture]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{YouTube| XaJtVG9Mcpo | \"Royal Navy Damage Control (The Modern Navy - State of Alert)\" }}\n{{Commons category-inline|Damage control}}\n\n{{Wiktionary-inline|damage control}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Damage Control}}\n[[Category:Navies]]\n[[Category:Ship management]]\n[[Category:Nautical terminology]]"}}}]}}}}
