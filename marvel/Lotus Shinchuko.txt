Additionally, a color Marvel comic titled simply ''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' was published as a 2014 miniseries.\n\n==Publishing history==\n''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' was published in the mid-to-late 1970s by [[Magazine Management]], a corporate sibling of [[Marvel Comics]], amid the [[martial arts]] movie fad of the time. Launched in 1974 as part of Magazine Management's [[List of comics magazines published by Magazine Management in the 1970s|line of black-and-white comics magazines]], it ran 33 issues through 1977.<ref name=gcd>[https://www.comics.org/series/2161/ ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> Recurring characters included:\n* The [[Sons of the Tiger]] \u2013 Three men and one woman linked by mystical amulets\n* The [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] \u2013 Heir to the amulets of the Sons of the Tiger\n* [[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Shang Chi, Master of Kung Fu]] (from Marvel Comics), incorporating characters and concepts licensed from the [[Sax Rohmer]] estate\n* [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] the Living Weapon (from Marvel Comics)\n* The [[Daughters of the Dragon]] \u2013 [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]] (characters derived from Marvel Comics' ''Iron Fist'' series)\n\nEach issue had comics stories featuring these characters, both single-issue stories and multi-issue story arcs.

Other issues had interviews with martial arts instructors, while others had interviews with movie or television celebrities related to martial arts.\n\nEarly issues had a martial arts instructional section which described some elementary fighting techniques. These were provided by comics illustrator/martial artist [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|Frank McLaughlin]]. The magazine was in [[black-and-white]] except for the cover.

They were created by [[Gerry Conway]] and drawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and first appeared in ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #1 (April 1974).\n\nThe Sons of the Tiger were three friends and martial arts students of Master Kee: Lin Sun, of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] ancestry, was the leader of the trio and adopted son of Master Kee; Abe Brown was an [[African American]] from the streets of [[Harlem]]; and [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Robert Diamond]] was a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor.\n\n====Publication history====\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\nThe Sons of the Tiger first appeared in comics published by [[Curtis Magazines]] (a short lived [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Marvel Comics]]) called ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu''. The series was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and drawn by [[Dick Giordano]], and was published in the early 1970s amidst the [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] or [[chopsocky]] movie craze.\n\nThe Sons of the Tiger made appearances in ''Special Collector's Edition: Savage Fists of Kung Fu'' #1. They also appeared in the ''Special Album Edition'' of ''The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu''. Both of these appearances contained the same story, titled \"The Master Plan of Fu Manchu\". In this story, the Sons of the Tiger team up with [[Shang-Chi]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. The ''Special Collector's Edition'' contained the story in color, while the ''Special Album Edition'' was in [[black-and-white]].\n\n====Fictional history====\n;Origin\nLin Sun is returning from a martial arts [[tournament]] with his first place [[trophy]] when he is suddenly attacked by [[ninja]]s in front of his school in [[San Francisco]]. After defeating the villains, he goes into the \"Tiger Dojo\", which has been ransacked. He finds a dying Master Kee, who tells him that there are forces in this world which would destroy us and then points to a box on a shelf, after which he dies. In the box, Lin finds three amulets made of [[jade]], a tiger's head and two claws: the symbol of the school. The inscription at the base of the box reads, \"When three are called and stand as one, as one they'll fight, their will be done...For each is born anew, The Tiger's Son.\" They are later known as \"the Amulets of Power\".\n\nSoon after, Lin meets up with his two friends, Abe Brown and Bob Diamond, who have also been attacked by ninjas. Lin recounts the story of Master Kee's death and gives each of them one of the jade tiger claw amulets. They soon discover that when they join hands and chant the inscription from the box they become mystically connected. Their martial arts skills combine to become one force and their physical abilities are tripled when they wear the amulets.\n\nDuring the series' run, the trio runs up against \"the Silent Ones\", an evil organization with mystical ties attempting to gain world domination.\n\nBeginning in ''Deadly Hands of Kung Fu'' #19, entitled \"An Ending\", the trio breaks up and Lin Sun throws all three amulets in a trash can located in an alley. There, Hector Ayala finds the amulets and wears them to become the [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]]. The Sons of the Tiger appeared in the next two stories, \"A Beginning\" and \"To Claw the Eyes of Night\", during the transition to the White Tiger stories. The character of Abe Brown is mostly seen periodically after that. The book continued using the title \"The Sons of the Tiger\", even though the trio had split up and power was transferred to the White Tiger.\n\nBob Diamond continued to make occasional appearances in ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' as [[Colleen Wing]]'s lover.\n\nThe Sons of the Tiger appeared briefly with [[Luke Cage]]'s Human Resistance after the [[Scarlet Witch]] altered the world during the ''[[House of M]]'' crossover, along with the [[Daughters of the Dragon]], the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and the [[Moon Knight]].
