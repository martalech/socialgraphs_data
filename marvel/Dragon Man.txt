Gregson hoped to find a way to bring it to life. He could not find a way to do this until the alchemist [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]] arrived and brought it to life under his partial control using his supernatural powers. However, Dragon Man broke his control and attempted to kill Diablo.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby]] | Inker = [[Chic Stone]] | Story = Calamity On The Campus! | Title = Fantastic Four | Volume = 1 | Issue = #35 | Date = February 1965 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Dragon Man is slow-minded to the point that he is incapable of speech, he understands orders given by Diablo and is a determined foe of the [[Fantastic Four]] (although the creature has always displayed a [[King Kong]]-like affection towards [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]]). Dragon Man is not especially malicious, although he is easily manipulated and provoked to violence.\n\nAfter his first activation, Dragon Man was later revived. He encountered [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], and fought the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44-47</ref>\n\nDragon Man was later studied by [[Hank Pym]] at his laboratory.

After a period of time on the team where he developed a deep affection for [[Jean Grey]], Dragon Man had to be released to the creature-filled island known in the Marvel Universe as Monster Island.\n\nDragon Man was reclaimed by Professor Gregson Gilbert and sent by [[Lemuel Dorcas]] to attack [[Namor]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #15</ref> It was next used by Gregory Gideon to attack the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #134-135</ref> Dragon Man was then sent by [[Machinesmith]] to attack [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #248-249</ref> He became the mount for the extra-dimensional dragon rider [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Ral Dorn|Ral Dorn]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #16</ref> Dragon Man then fought [[Hulk]] and [[Kate Waynesboro]] when it was under the control of [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] and the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #292</ref>\n\nDragon Man encountered the child superheroes called [[Power Pack]]. Gregson Gilbert later attempted to replicate the creation of the Dragon Man without the addition of alchemical interruptions, and this time succeeded. He created a number of androids based on other [[legendary creature]]s. These androids were defeated by Power Pack, and Gilbert and Dragon Man go to work at Disneyland.<ref>''Power Pack'' #7</ref>\n\nDragon Man was used as a servant of [[Aron (comics)|Aron]] the Rogue [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #321-323, 327-330, 332-333</ref>\n\nHe faced [[Spider-Man]] during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', when he was unleashed on him by [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #61</ref>\n\nIn addition to his servitude to Diablo, Dragon Man has served [[Super-Adaptoid]] and was also a member of the [[New Enforcers]]. In ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #235-6, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] sprung him from a government containment facility in order to capture and dissect him to create robotic super-soldiers based on Dragon Man's powers. He was freed by [[Ben Reilly]].\n\nDragon Man showed up in Africa under the influence of mad scientist '''Eric Pain'''.<ref>''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 4 #8-9 and ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #175-176</ref> Though the creature was under a full rage, he ended up defeated once more by both superheroes. Afterwards, he resurfaced in [[Beyond!]], destroying an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] the group was using to escape.\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline,<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #4</ref> he was spotted at the funeral of [[Stilt-Man]]. After poisoning the guests, the [[Punisher]] blew up the bar in which the wake had been held. He was later seen being arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #9</ref>\n\n[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #13</ref> including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Quincy McIver|Bushmaster]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, the Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].\n\nIn ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #8, Dragon Man had been captured by the trainee heroes, having been attracted to [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]].\n\nIn ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'', Dragon Man was seen battling the newly revived ''Nova Corps'' consisting of Qubit, Fraktur, Tracel, Morrow, Irani, and Robbie Rider. He was subdued by the Corps using a gravimetric net.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #20</ref>\n\nAt one point, Dragon Man had been placed in the [[Negative Zone]], and like most of the other prisoners, was conscripted into service when [[Blastaar]] attacked the prison. When the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Shadow Initiative]] was sent in to liberate the prison, Blastaar sent Dragon Man against them. However, Komodo was able to use Dragon Man's attraction to her to convince him to switch sides.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27</ref>\n\nFollowing this, he seemingly reforms, as he, [[Artie Maddicks|Artie]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] were seen at [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' birthday party.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #574</ref>\n\nHe has since been upgraded by [[Valeria Richards]] and joined Reed Richards' [[Future Foundation]]. Valeria used her talents to upgrade Dragon Man to have super-intellect and have the power of human speech. Dragon Man would become an adopted member of the Future Foundation and guardian of the gifted children in that program.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four579\">''Fantastic Four'' #579</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Dragon Man created the Thing Rings for Darla Deering to wear which enables her to become Miss Thing upon some particles enabling her to transform into her Thing Exoskeleton (which was also modified by Dragon Man).<ref>''Marvel NOW! Point One'' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDragon Man gains its powers from its robotic materials, design, and construction, as well as unknown alchemical potions used by [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. Dragon Man is superhumanly strong and durable. He is able to stand toe to toe with the likes of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the [[Hulk]] in combat situations. He can use the wings on his back to fly. He can also exhale methane gas (produced by his digestive system) which can be ignited by striking together his specialized teeth, producing flame hot enough to melt [[iron]].\n\nThe Dragon Man originally could military press sixty tons. Since it was a machine imbued with magic the artificial creature never grows tired. It can recharge itself by eating organic materials, and its wings did not allow it to fly. It uses two anti gravity generators located in its body to propel itself. Its large wings give it great mobility in the air.\n\nDragon Man was initially non-sentient, but had the capacity for limited self-motivated activity.\n\nDragon Man has been reprogrammed by Valeria Richards and now has super-intellect and the capability of human speech.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four579\"/>\n\nDragon Man is vulnerable to intense cold and certain ultrasonic frequencies.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Earth X===\nIn the ''[[Earth X]]'' reality, Dragon Man had come into possession of King Britain, who would use the android as a steed in combat.<ref>''Earth-X'' #10</ref>\n\n===JLA/Avengers===\nDragon Man appears as a villain in the series, appearing in the last battle restrained by [[Green Lantern]] and breathing fire at [[Superman]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Dragon Man appears in the 1978 ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series.{{cn|date=October 2020}} This version was an android built for good by Professor Gilbert before its controls were stolen by his assistant, George.
