While still a fetus, Laura protected her twin sister by using her mutant abilities to send her to another dimension, dubbed \"Liveworld\".\n\nLaura grew up withdrawn from the world.

Petra first appears in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #1 (2006) and was created by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Pete Woods]]. She is one of the \"Missing X-Men\". The word \"petra\" means \"rocky\" in Latin, and \"stone\" in [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\nPetra was the first of her family to be born in the [[United States]]. Her mother, father, and brother emigrated from [[Denmark]] while her mother was pregnant with Petra. They lived the typical American life in the suburbs of [[New York City]] for most of Petra's childhood. Shortly after her thirteenth birthday, Petra's family was killed by a rockslide while on a camping trip. Unknowingly, Petra used her mutant powers of earth manipulation to avoid getting hurt.\n\nAfter spending weeks in Child Protective Services, Petra was sent to live in [[New Jersey]] in a foster home. She was placed in a home that had five other children that were forced to share the same bedroom. Her foster mother was old and uncaring, and her foster father was too caring, trying to [[Sexual abuse|hold and touch]] Petra all the time. One day on an outing to [[Central Park]], Petra's foster father tried to touch her but sank knee-deep into the ground. It was then that Petra realized that she was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and she ran away. She found a cave and hid there for days crying, knowing that with her abilities she could have either killed or saved her family.\n\nShe camped in [[Central Park]] for a couple of years, using her power to manipulate rock caves into shelters to avoid being arrested and sent to juvenile detention centers. When she was sixteen, she discovered another useful aspect of her ability: she could turn [[coal]] into [[diamond]]s by concentrating hard enough. For a year, she used this aspect of her power to make diamonds of varying sizes to sell to [[pawn shop]]s so she could buy food and survive.\n\nOne day, however, a pawn shop employee said he was going to call the owner of the store, but he called the police. Running to her rock shelter, the police found Petra before she could hide, and took her into custody after a brief battle. When she awoke, a female guard informed her that she was being released into the custody of a woman, later revealed to be [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], who was there to help Petra. This at first frightened Petra because she had never known anyone to try to help her because of her abilities, only hurt her.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1</ref>\n\nAfter some time with Dr. MacTaggert, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] took Petra and the other children within custody ([[Sway (comics)|Sway]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]) to rescue the original [[X-Men]] team trapped on the mutant island [[Krakoa]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Petra instinctively used her powers to bury Vulcan and Darwin, and then gets incinerated by the volcano creature that was created by Krakoa.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #6</ref>\n\nWhen the X-Men establish Krakoa as a mutant paradise, Petra was among the revived mutants living there, She, Sway, and Vulcan was residing in the Summer House.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #8</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Empyre]]\" storyline, Petra and Sway have a drink with Vulcan at the Summer House on the Moon. After Vulcan defeated his [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] attackers, Petra and Sway catch up to him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 5 #10</ref>\n\nPetra was a \"terrakinetic\" or \"geo-morph\",<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #4</ref> having the ability to [[psychokinetic]]ally manipulate, control, levitate and reshape the classic element of [[earth]]\u2014[[sand]], [[stone]], [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[lava]], and/or dirt\u2014and could even transform the consistency of earth and rock, such as turning a lump of [[coal]] into a [[diamond]].<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1</ref> She also could use this power to cause minor [[earthquakes]] and create shapes out of solid rock.\n\n===Petra in other media===\nA character with both Petra's striking resemblance and powers appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series: '''Christy Nord''' (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]). This iteration is the daughter of [[kinetic energy]] absorbing mutant [[David North (comics)|Christopher Nord]]. Like Petra, she has the mutant ability to manipulate the earth and stone. In the episode \"Past Discretions\", she was seen in flashbacks living with Christopher on a farm near the Canadian border at the age of 6, when her father became [[Team X (comics)|Team X]]'s target. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] was sent to capture Nord, only to realize this could make Christy an orphan. Ten years later, Wolverine reappears to which Christy attacks him for apparently being responsible for her being an orphan. However, Christy realizes that Wolverine had saved her and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] was responsible for her father's apparent demise. In the episode \"Stolen Lives\", Christy gets abducted by Maverick for [[Abraham Cornelius|Dr. Abraham Cornelius]] and [[Professor Thorton]], however, she is rescued by Wolverine and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. With [[Emma Frost]]'s help, Christy reunites with her father.\n\n==Mike Peterson==\n{{main|Deathlok (Michael Peterson)}}\n\n==Phage==\n'''Phage''' is the name used by a [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. The symbiote, created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Ron Lim]], first appeared in ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' #4 (May 1993), and was named in ''Carnage, U.S.A.'' #2 (March 2012) after an unrelated character from the ''Venom: The Hunted'' comic storyline and ''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' toy line.<ref>Stuart Vandal.

His twin children, [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Nikolai Krylenko]] and [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Laynia Petrovna]], were taken from birth by the Soviet government to be trained as soldiers, after their mutant natures manifested.\n\nSergei eventually became one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government.  However, despite being a scientific genius, he was also quite mad. He caused a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster in the \"Forbidden Zone\" using cobalt radiation baths and a nuclear blast, which transformed Tania Belinsky into his super-powered thrall as the second [[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Red Guardian]]. The nuclear energy transformed Sergei into a superhuman being as well, and he could now generate nuclear energy within his own body for various uses. Sergi began calling himself \"The Presence\". The Presence and Red Guardian battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] when they came to find her. The Presence left when she regained her free will and spurned him.<ref>''The Defenders'' #52-55</ref> Soon after, the Presence battled a giant mutated amoeba in the \"Forbidden Zone\", and was then reunited and reconciled with Red Guardian.<ref>''The Defenders'' #61-63, 65</ref>\n\nThe government now wanted the threat of the Presence eliminated. His own children had been trained by the government as super-powered soldiers and, unaware of their true relationship, were sent to kill him. Alongside the Red Guardian, Presence encountered the [[Hulk]], [[Professor Phobos]], and the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] in the \"Forbidden Zone\". Darkstar and Vanguard learned that the Presence was their father and turned against the Soviet regime, and saved the Presence from Phobos. In order to save the Soviet Union from the dangerous, spreading radiation of the so-called Forbidden Zone, an irradiated Soviet wasteland, the Presence and the Red Guardian absorbed all the radiation into themselves and left for outer space, where they claimed they would transform themselves into inert matter.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #258-259</ref> The twins became agents on their own, fighting for the good of the people, and sometimes working with their father.\n\nThe Presence was revealed to be held prisoner with Red Guardian (now calling herself '''[[Starlight (Marvel Comics)|Starlight]]''') on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory world.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> The pair returned to Earth with the [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]].

The Presence learned of the Soviet Union's collapse, and returned to Russia with the intent to create a \"new order\".<ref>''Quasar'' #45-46</ref> Later, the Presence sent Starlight to capture the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and Darkstar.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #70</ref>\n\nVanguard was ultimately killed in a battle while he and Darkstar were aiding the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. Darkstar blamed Quasar for her brother's death and fled back to Russia. When she encountered her father, Darkstar shared her feelings with him, and the Presence forced Quasar to flee [[Earth]] on the threat of killing Quasar's loved ones. Sergei visited his son's memorial and sought to revive him by shifting his atoms to microscopically enter Vanguard's body.  There he discovered a trace of Vanguard's mutant energy remained, keeping him faintly alive. The Presence managed to use this energy to resurrect his son, but nearly exhausted his own power, and was cast adrift in the subatomic reality he had entered.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\nWhile in subatomic exile, the Presence discovered new aspects of his power and atomic particles, and, when he had sufficiently regenerated, resumed his normal size and returned to the Forbidden Zone. There, he embarked on a plan to unite all of the former Soviet Union by transforming its people into a race of zombie-like radioactive beings living under a communal mind.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #42</ref> He managed to convert several Siberian scientists, Vanguard and the rest of the [[Winter Guard]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who investigated the disturbance, leaving only [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the seemingly-immortal [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]] to stand against him.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #43</ref> As Thor threatened to kill the Presence, Starlight, as the Presence's companion, ultimately offered their surrender and used her own power to revive those who had been transformed and remand herself and the Presence to Russian custody; she did not share his vision, but their powers meant that they would only ever have each other for company, and so she wished to keep him alive.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol.3) #44</ref> In the final struggle of the [[Kang Dynasty|Kang War]], the Presence and Starlight aided in the struggle to destroy [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s Damocles Base space station,<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #52</ref> with Starlight blackmailing the Presence for assistance by threatening to leave him if he attempted anything more than simply doing his job and subsequently returning to his cell.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol.3 #53</ref>\n\nIn the 2010 ''Darkstar and Winter Guard'' limited series, The Presence was apparently destroyed permanently when the Russian superhero Powersurge sacrificed his life to defeat him after he once again tried to conquer Russia after Starlight left him for good to join the People's Protectorate, where she fell in love with his son, [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Gourley |url=http://swordandscript.com/general/the-sword-and-script-interview-david-gallaher |title=The Sword and Script Interview: David Gallaher |publisher=Sword and Script |date=April 20, 2010 |access-date=May 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521012134/http://swordandscript.com/general/the-sword-and-script-interview-david-gallaher |archive-date=May 21, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mahadeo |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26323 |title=Gallaher Thaws Out the Winter Guard |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 21, 2010 |access-date=May 21, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Darkstar-Ellis-Gallaher-100525.html |title=From High Moon to DARKSTAR: Zuda Alums Talk Russian Heroes |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=May 25, 2010 |access-date=June 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Deadpool and the Mercs for Money'', the Presence is briefly revived by Umbral Dynamics (a corporation secretly led by Caroline Le Fay) by harvesting the power of several superhumans with radiation-related powers.
