He was formerly married to [[Silver Sable]].\n\nThe Foreigner is a mercenary and assassin. Although he has no superhuman abilities, he has trained his body to be in absolute peak physical condition, is among the greatest martial arts practitioners in the Marvel Universe, and as a professional assassin, who has evaded detection by various international law enforcement agencies, is highly intelligent. He is often depicted as being exceedingly competent.\n\n==Publication history==\nWriter [[Peter David]] created the Foreigner as a master assassin character to be a nemesis for Spider-Man. According to David, the character was designed to bear a strong resemblance to [[Patrick McGoohan]].<ref name=PDTwistedStories>[[David, Peter]].

Reprinted from \"But I Digress...\" ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1169 (April 12, 1996).</ref> The character's voice was first heard on a telephone in a scene in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #15 (June 1986), which was written by [[David Michelinie]], but he did not make a full, visual appearance until later that year in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #116 (July 1986).\n\nThe Foreigner was favored by editor [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Jim Owsley]] as the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s true identity.<ref name=PDTwistedStories/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Foreigner first appeared as a foe of [[Spider-Man]] when making a wager with another villain, [[Chance (comics)#Chance (Nicholas Powell)|Chance]], that the latter could not defeat and kill Spider-Man. The Foreigner won this wager.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> In an attempt to impress the Foreigner, the assassin [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] volunteered to kill the thief known as the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] who had stolen a solid gold notebook from the Foreigner's office. However, Spider-Man intervened and defeated Sabretooth.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #115-116. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, he defeated the Black Cat himself and then decided, instead of executing, to start a romantic relationship to use under the pretense of forming an alliance in order to destroy Spider-Man (all the while the true ulterior motive being to enlist the membership of Spider-Man as an assassin in his 1400 Club). Spider-Man turned him down and the Foreigner was forced to abandon that identity.\n\nThe Foreigner hired an assassin to assume the identity of Blaze to fire-bomb the Black Cat's apartment. Disguised as Lieutenant Kris Keating, the Foreigner killed Blaze and framed Spider-Man for the job.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #125. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Keating, the Foreigner escaped an assassination attempt by the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref> He finally battled Spider-Man for the first time, and was betrayed by the Black Cat.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Foreigner hired the Hobgoblin to steal an incriminating ledger from the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #130. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Foreigner was defeated by [[Silver Sable]] in a fencing duel.<ref>''Silver Sable'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Richard Fisk#Rose|Blood Rose]] hired the Foreigner, who in turn hired the Hunters and the [[New Enforcers]] to bring down the remnants of the Kingpin's empire.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #97-100. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the past, he has started a club of assassins called the 1400 Club. The [[CIA]], [[FBI]], and most government agencies throughout the world are not aware of the Foreigner's existence or that of his organization. As a master of disguise, he has literally hundreds of identities all over the world. These identities are used not only by him, but by other members of his organization who are also masters of disguise and assassination.\n\nHe was formerly married to Silver Sable, and was romantically involved for a short time with the Black Cat. He is a friend of Wilson Fisk and it is rumored that the two were friends when the Foreigner was hired to kill Fisk by one of his enemies but the Foreigner discovered they had the same birthday and capriciously decided to kill his employer instead. Later, he met Fisk and initiated their friendship/business relationship.\n\nThe Foreigner was once hired to kill the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] by the mercenary [[Jason Macendale]] (who later himself became the Hobgoblin). He carried out the execution of [[Ned Leeds]]. The Foreigner's men made quick work and slit Leeds's throat.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #289\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later revealed that Leeds was actually a puppet of the [[Roderick Kingsley|original Hobgoblin]] who had abandoned the persona to avoid such an assassination.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #289\"/> Later he hired Whisper, Pulse, Swift, and Warfare to kill [[Betty Brant|Betty Brant Leeds]], who was seeking to expose the Foreigner's role in Ned's death. He revealed to Betty that Leeds was supposedly the original Hobgoblin.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #91-92. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt some time in the past, the Foreigner trained the superhuman mutant known as Sabretooth. He has since distanced himself from his former novice. It seems the Foreigner shuns Sabretooth's murderous nature, at least in so much that Sabretooth even kills people when it is not profitable, which the Foreigner considers bad business practice.\n\nHe has been hired by many different characters to carry out various assassinations. He has never been incarcerated or positively identified by authorities. The few cases in which he did not carry out his objectives tended to be due to his personal whimsy and not his inability. The Foreigner's real name and origin have yet to be revealed and although he speaks with a British accent, he may not be British.\n\nAt one point, machinations by [[Justin Hammer]] turned the 1400 Club against him and the organization was destroyed; the Foreigner did not seem to intend to rebuild it, as he realized the whole thing was too unwieldy and bloated for his tastes.\n\nIt was discovered that Foreigner is the one responsible for murdering [[Thunderbolt Ross]], and framing [[Captain America]] for the crime.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 9 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> A somehow revived and rejuvenated [[Peggy Carter]], operating as Dryad, takes down Foreigner's New York-based safe houses.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 9 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Peggy confronts Foreigner and fights him until [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] shoot a missile at them. Peggy survives the attack, while Foreigner presumably perishes.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 9 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nForeigner visited [[Chance (comics)|Chance]]'s airborne casino called the Palace where he got swindled by Chance. Foreigner is tricked and pressured by Chance into covering the night's debts if he can steal Spider-Man's web-shooters.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #38-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> Both of them succeeded with help from the [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lanterns]]. Then Chance had to reluctantly agree to become Foreigner's business partner.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #40. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter Foreigner and Chance found out that Empire State University student Jamie Tolentino used the Clairvoyant to win all bets and racked up a debt when it ran out of battery power, they were told by Jamie that he can get him the Catalyst as a power source for the Clairvoyant.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #67. Marvel Comics.</ref> They succeed despite the intervention of Spider-Man and both devices are now in the Palace. It is then revealed that the Jack O'Lanterns, [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], and many of the Palace's patrons are actually sleeper agents of Finisher and [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]] as they start to trash the Palace.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #68-69. Marvel Comics.</ref> Foreigner and Chance persuaded [[Slyde]] to work for them with a doubled pay while Jack O'Lantern fought the Jack O'Lanterns. Spider-Man and Jamie were able to prevent the Palace from crashing into Manhattan. Afterwards with his bank accounts drained by Spider-Man and [[Ned Leeds]], Foreigner hires [[Taskmaster (character)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] to assist in his payback plot.<ref>''Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: The Chameleon Conspiracy'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Sinister War]]\" storyline, Foreigner, Taskmaster, Black Ant, Chance, Jack O'Lantern, and Slyde are sent by [[Kindred (Marvel Comics)|Kindred]] to attack Spider-Man after Kindred had disrupted their armored car robbery.<ref>''Sinister War'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Foreigner has no superhuman abilities. However, he has trained his body to be in peak physical condition. He is stronger, faster, more agile, and has better reaction time than any Olympic athlete. He is adept in all known forms of martial arts, and most forms of conventional hand weaponry. He is among the greatest pugilists in the Marvel Universe, similar in ability to [[Captain America]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. His skills are such that even without superhuman abilities, he is able to pull off seemingly inhuman feats of strength through intense concentration, and has even battled Spider-Man to a stand still.{{fact|date=December 2021}}\n\nHe possesses a near-mystic ability to place an opponent in a 10-second hypnotic trance through eye-contact, which makes the opponent believe the Foreigner can move faster than the eye can see. He has hypnotized Spider-Man in this fashion, which left Spider-Man disoriented or in a light trance for a few seconds while the Foreigner ran away at what seemed to be nearly superhuman speed; from Spider-Man's perspective it appeared that the Foreigner had teleported away. The Foreigner uses this ability for evading enemies.{{fact|date=December 2021}}\n\nHe is a master of disguise and has assumed various identities all over the world. He is a brilliant strategist, tactician, and intelligence gatherer who has somehow escaped much notice from governments and their agencies, leaving it to Spider-Man and other superheroes to handle him.{{fact|date=December 2021}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=7372|title=Foreigner}}\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter David]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}}}]}}}}
